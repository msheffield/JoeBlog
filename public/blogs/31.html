            <p><em>Cancer update #27</em></p>


            <p>
                Well this is a long overdue blog update, and might make for a long blog. It has been a few months since
                I last blogged and a lot has happened in that time. The last few months have probably been the hardest
                of my life.
            </p>

            <p>
                Last I left off, I was feeling good and Cristina and I were about to head out to Hawaii for some much
                needed rest and sun and relaxation. Unfortunately that didnt happen. A few days before we were supposed
                to leave, Cristina, myself and our friend Kipp were playing a board game at our place. Everything was
                going well until the game ended and we started to clean up. I immediately felt like something was wrong
                and tried to walk to the bedroom to lay down. I collapsed about halfway there. Thankfully Kipp was there
                to get me into bed but I was in a bad way. Cristina ended up calling 911 because I was in extreme pain
                and couldn't move at all. I was taken to the hospital and they quickly realized that there was some
                internal bleeding going on with my tumor.
            </p>

            <p>
                That ER visit turned into a 13 day stay total in which a lot of changes took place. We paused the chemo
                regimine I was on so that I could start some radiation treatments in the hope that the radiation would
                scar the tumor enough to get it to stop bleeding. The bleeding issues were complicated by the fact that
                I have to be on blood thinners. I also received a lot of blood transfusions. I had 18 units of blood in
                13 days, so thank you to all the blood donors out there, you helped save my life.
            </p>

            <p>
                Also while I was in the hospital, they discovered a ton of blood clots throughout my body. I had a bunch
                in my legs, a bunch in my lungs, and one very scary one in my heart. When they found the one in my
                heart, the overnight doctor had to check with me on what I wanted to do in the case that it breaks free
                and gave me a heart attack or stopped me from breathing. He wantedto know if I wanted to have
                resusitation given (even though it would probably be futile), or if I just wanted to let nature take its
                course. It was a very intense night. To try and mitigate the clots in my legs from migrating up into my
                lungs, I have had a little mesh filter inserted to try and catch these clots. They insert the filter
                through the neck and down into my abdominal area. The only problem is that my blood is so clot prone
                that now I have clots growing off of the filter. My doctors have been tweaking my blood thinner dosages
                and hopefully it is under control right now.
            </p>

            <p>
                The hospital stay really took it out of me. I have never felt weaker than when I left the hospital after
                13 days. I had lost about 20 lbs and couldn't walk very far because of the clot burden in my lungs. I
                would get super winded just standing up for too long. I had to leave the hospital in a wheelchair.
                Thankfully with the new blood thinners I am on, I think the clot burden is decreasing because I seem to
                have more energy and stamina and am no longer needing a wheelchair.
            </p>

            <p>
                I still haven't gained the weight back and my swallowing has not really gotten any easier so this brings
                me to my second hospitalization. A few weeks ago at the beginning of March I entered the hospital again,
                this time it was scheduled though as I have had a feeding tube placed to help me get the nutrients I
                need to gain weight. Unfortunately the tube is pretty annoying. It is like an ambilical cord coming out
                of my stomach. I load up a syringe with some Ensure-like substance and inject it directly into my
                stomach through the tube. It is super weird. Also I am a stomach sleeper so learning to sleep on my side
                or back has been a little annoying. I am super bony so side sleeping is really uncomfortable on my hips
                and ribs. Cristina and I got a new mattress with a pillow top that hopefully will help when it comes!
            </p>

            <p>
                Thats about all thats new on the medical front with me. I am spending my days just trying to get
                stronger and getting enough nutrition. All sorts of other stuff and thoughts have been going on though
                the last few months and I think I'll run through my thoughts on them in the sections below.
            </p>

            <h2>Death and Spirituality</h2>

            <p>
                I've come to understand that I am going to die from this cancer. The hope is that I get a lot of time
                left from the amazing medical care I am getting, but one way or another, this cancer is going to get me.
                I hope that this new chemo I am on works for a long time and when it stops working there is some new
                therapy that I can try that keeps the good news going. I have the best doctor in the world and she does
                a great job of letting me know that we're going to throw the kitchen sink at this thing but she will be
                the first to tell me when there isn't really much more that we can do, and I really appreciate that.
            </p>

            <p>
                I've had to think about my own mortality a lot since the start of 2018. That night in the hospital when
                the clot was discovered was really intense and scary. I think the doctor actually thought I was going to
                die. My dad was there and I just looked at him and started crying and the only thing I remember saying
                was that "there was so much more that I wanted to do." I am also living with this spectre of the blood
                clots looming over me and while I don't think about them all the time, I have to inject myself with
                blood thinner twice a day so I'm sort of constantly reminded of it. I just have to wake up every day and
                hope that today isn't the day that one of them decides to break free and stop my heart or my breathing.
            </p>

            <p>
                I've been an Athiest my whole life. I grew up in the Unitarian Church but I think I've always been a
                non-believer. I like to think that I've done a lot of maturing in my beliefs though. Ten years ago I was
                much more vocal and annoying but I hope I've become a lot more tolerant and understanding of other
                folk's spirituality as I get older. Anyways, it is hard to think about death with no afterlife. I hope
                that I've done enough in my short time on this earth to have made a little mark and that whenever the
                time comes I can say that I lived a good and full life and I didn't waste what a gift it was.
            </p>

            <p>
                One other interesting aspect of this whole cancer process is interacting with people of other faiths
                that know my beliefs and say things like "I'm praying for you, for what its worth" or things like that.
                When someone tells me they are praying for me I feel so honored because it means that a) they took a
                little time out of their busy life to think about me and b) in the context of their own spirituality,
                they care about my spiritual well being. Thank you for all your prayers and well wishes. My amazing
                grandma calls me every day to tell me that she is "praying to St. Anthony" for me. I can't tell you how
                much every prayer, email, text fills my own spirit and helps me get through the day so I just wanted to
                say thank you everyone.
            </p>

            <h2>The Politics of Being Ill</h2>

            <p>
                I try and avoid talking politics but my own adventures with the medical insurance industry keep pulling
                me back into the fray. I love this coutry and think that it has amazing potential for growth but we have
                so much to work on to fulfill the promise of our founding.
            </p>

            <p>
                On March 1st, the day I was scheduled to go in and get my feeding tube inserted in the hospital, I found
                out I had been kicked off my Obamacare Medicaid expansion coverage and was insuranceless. I had to
                scramble to get financial assistance from UW to still undergo the procedure, then I had to start
                shopping for my own insurance through the healthplan finder.
            </p>

            <p>
                The reason I was kicked off my old insurance was that I had started to collect disability and was
                earning too much to qualify for the insurance. I have not worked since I was diagnosed. I would love to
                work, I am dying to work, but I am in and out of the hospital sometimes multiple times a week. Sometimes
                I wake up so weak I can't get out of bed. I was tired of not contributing anything but my own savings
                financially to my family so I started to collect disability so that I could contribute more.
            </p>

            <p>
                This really threw a wrench in my insurance situation. Currently, I make $1590 a month from disability. I
                now pay $232 a month for a silver insurance plan, I pay car insurance on a paid off car because I have
                to be able to drive to and from all my medical stuff, I pay a cell phone bill because I have to
                communicate with all sorts of medical folks, and I contribute to the rent in our house. This leaves me
                with a few hundred bucks every month for food and entertainment if I'm feeling strong enough to get out
                of the house. This week I was informed by my new insurance provider that for my next months supply of
                blood thinner, it would cost me $2348.64. I basically burst into tears. Thank god I have my own savings
                plus an incredibly supportive family that can step in and help out when I need it. I can't imagine
                anyone going through this alone having to deal with this shit on top of their cancer.
            </p>

            <p>
                How can we live in a country that doesn't provide health care for it's citizens. When I was working I
                would have loved to have had a little bit from each paycheck I was earning go towards universal health
                care for everyone in this country. For one year I was going through this not having to worry about my
                insurance coverage because I was under the amazing Medicaid expansion and in the past month I have had
                multiple incredibly stressful days trying to coordinate how I was going to pay for the care that
                literally keeps me alive.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is really troubling. I know there are so many issues going on in this country. We are deporting
                good Americans back to the countries they fled from. People are languishing in jails for years for
                victemless crimes. People of color are day in and day out mistreated by the people sworn to protect
                them. And we are led by a deviant sex weirdo who's only good quality is that his own complete buffoonery
                and incompetence grinds his agenda to a screeching halt every other day. But recently I've been really
                hopeful from the progressive movement that is going on across the country. Tomorrow I hope to
                participate in the March For Our Lives here in Seattle that has been organized by a youth movement that
                is really inspiring. The DSA across the country seems to be getting stronger every day. Republicans are
                being voted out at every turn and centrist Democrats seem to be getting called out more on their
                waffling on progressive issues. This all gives me hope that even though I might not see it, one day
                someone like me won't have to worry if they can afford blood thinner this month.
            </p>

            <h2>Other Miscellanea</h2>

            <p>
                Being sick is really hard. It is hard to wake up and go to bed in pain every day. It sucks not to be
                able to walk longer than a few minutes without having to sit down and take a breather. It really drains
                the spirit. Sometimes I can be short and grumpy with my friends or family and if I have done that, I am
                truly sorry. I love you all and I hate when I let my illness get the better of me. Thank you for always
                being there for me.
            </p>

            <p>
                My family got us all tickets to Hamilton and it was amazing! If you have the opportunity to go, do it. I
                was a little skeptical because the only musicals I have really ever enjoyed were The Book of Mormon and
                Les Miserables, but add Hamilton to that list. Here is a pic of Cristina and I at the show.

                I am getting stronger every day! I have been swalling a little better these last couple weeks and the
                feeding tube is helping me get the nutrition I desperately need. The sun was out the other day and I had
                enough energy to walk down the street to the park with Cristina and Coop! It felt so good to get out of
                the house and get some vitamin D. Here's hopeing for a good spring from my family to yours.

                Coop continues to be a source of joy and inspiration in our lives. He is growing up and getting more
                vocal and energetic. On sunny days I enjoy sitting on our stoop and throwing the ball to him in our
                yard. He lifts my spirits when I'm down by continuing to love to snuggle. He is really affectionate an
                we continue to count ourselves so lucky we found him.

                Sorry this has been a long blog but I feel like I've had a lot to catch you up on! Despite my
                limitations, Cristina and I still have hopes to travel and explore and get out this year. Our travel
                plans will probably be limited to shorter weekend flights or road trips, as unfortunately my unstable
                medical condition can really mess up a nicely planned vacation. My brother Mike is coming to town to
                visit and I can't wait to see him! I'm hoping to get strong enough to be able to stand in front of a
                stove for an afternoon and cook. I continue to be inspired by food and as insidious as this cancer is to
                food lovers, I am going to try and keep my spirits up and eat what I can. I'm still loving music so I'll
                leave you with some good stuff I've been listening to lately. Thank you for reading and I love you all
                so much.
            </p>
