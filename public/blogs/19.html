            <p>
                Sorry I missed last week! Cristina and I decided to go camping, which was very much needed, so I missed
                last week. The last two weeks have brought a bunch of good change to our lives. Had a nice off chemo
                week last week and we bought a new car! We went with a Subaru Forester. It is time to sell the truck,
                which is way too big for Seattle. I am still having neuropathy and still having weird tastes in my
                mouth. I looked in the mirror the other day and holy hell my hair is thinning. Thankfully I was blessed
                with a large head and an incredibly thick head of hair so I have a lot to lose. It is very weird every
                time I am in the shower and I run my hands through my hair and they are just covered in hair that has
                fallen out.
            </p>

            <p>
                Also last week we went to our 5th Mariners game. The tickets were gifted to us by my very generous
                former teacher Laurie Mullarky. Thank you Laurie and Craig! Cristina and I are somehow 5-0 at Mariners
                games this year. Last week we drove all over the greater Seattle area looking for a dog to adopt! We
                went to 5 animal shelters. They were all packed with dogs, and there were lots of adorable ones, but in
                the end we didn't find the perfect buddy to adopt. Lots of suffering dogs that probably need more
                medical or emotional care than we can provide. Hopefully they can find nice homes with big yards and
                families with the means to help. We were undeterred though, and last Friday I went out again and found
                the perfect dog. He still needed to be neutered, so we put in our paperwork and waited until Tuesday,
                when we could take him home. He is a gentle, sweet, intelligent, affectionate 5 month old guy named
                Cooper. We love him very much.
            </p>

                I had chemo this week and he provided some much needed snuggles after I was disconnected on Thursday.
                This week's chemo didn't give me really any of the bad symptoms except I felt extremely fatigued. I
                think my body is getting tired of it, but the exercise I can get on the off weeks is doing good things
                helping me cope. Here is Coop and I asleep on our couch on Thursday:

                Andy was my chemo buddy this week. Thanks Andy! To pass the time during chemo I helped him study for the
                bar, since I'm pretty much an expert, and we had a nice nurse that provided some good laughs. Here is a
                little snap story of the day and some shots of the new pup we picked up afterwards!

            <p>
                So lots of big changes this week! Cristina and I have always talked about wanting a dog, and getting a
                new car and selling the truck, and doing a bunch more camping and traveling. I think we pushed ourselves
                to get some of that done this week because, as I talked about before, now its all about living out our
                bucket list and saying yes more. We probably could have waited a bit to do some of this stuff but life
                is too short.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thinking about cancer this week, Cristina showed me a quote from Thoreau that I thought was nice:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>There is one consolation in being sick; and that is the possibility that you may recover to a better
                    state than you were ever in before.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                I think this is pretty true. I plan on getting healthy and beating this tumor, and it is a great
                consolation to me that I know I will be in a better state than before. I feel like I've even started the
                process of getting to a better state already. Why wait til I'm healthy? Being sick sucks, the treatment
                sucks, but everything else about my life is so much better right now. I feel wrapped in love by my
                friends and family, I feel really healthy and strong during my off chemo weeks, and I'm living my life
                more deliberately and purposfully.
            </p>

            <p>
                Been listening to a lot of new tunes lately. Here is a great one for your enjoyment.
