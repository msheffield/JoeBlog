            <p>
                This week started off with some great family time with relatives from the McClenahan/Weber side of my
                family. Folks were in town from near an far to remember and celebrate my Grandma Nelle who passed away
                last November. This was a fantastic gathering that grandma would have loved, and she was missed greatly.
            </p>

                Round 2 of chemo is in the books. Here I am still feeling pretty decent in the morning getting my
                infusion. I'm also enjoying making the snap stories of my time there because it can get a little boring.

                So how am I feeling this week? I have more energy than round 1. My blood count is up which means the
                tumor has at least slowed down with the bleeding. This means I have more red blood cells, and so more
                energy! This round did come with a lot more of the neuropathy. This is a side effect of the drug that I
                take home and is slowly infused into my port for 46 hours. Basically, occasionally parts of my body will
                go numb, lock up, or get tingly from cold sensations. This feels weird, and can make doing normal things
                difficult. Thankfully it comes and goes and doesn't last very long.

                The last thing I am going to write about cancer today is that April happens to be Esophageal Cancer
                Awareness Month. Yes, it <a
                    href=http://www.cancercenter.com/discussions/blog/think-periwinkle-for-esophageal-cancer-awareness-month />really
                is a thing.</a> We kind of got the short straw on the cancer awareness colors, because periwinkle is not
                the easiest color to wear confidently, but oh well. Esophageal cancer is a pretty gnarly in that they
                really don't <a
                    href=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/esophagus-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/detection.html>screen</a>
                for it unless you have something called Barrett's Esophagus, or GERD. In my case, I had neither. The
                only indication that anything was wrong was I was having difficulty swallowing and some weight loss.
                This is why this cancer is so insidious: by the time I had started to show symptoms, the cancer had
                already spread and I was already stage IV. Anyways, I don't have much else to say except lets all try
                and be aware of this disease, and if you do have some of the early precursors, ask your doctor about
                getting an endoscopy to see if anything bad is going on down there.

                This weekend I'm going to see Radiohead with Sam and Evan and Lauren and I'm very excited. Here is my
                favorite Radiohead song for your listening pleasure.
