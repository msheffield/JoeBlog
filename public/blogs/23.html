            <p><em>Cancer update #19</em></p>

            <p>
                Well its been a busy three weeks away from the blog but I'm still here, and apparently I still have cancer.  It has been a busy few weeks full of visits from friends, family and doctors.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Cristina's brother Alan and nephew Ephraim came and stayed with us for a visit!  We had a blast, and went car camping all across the Olympic peninsula.  Visited Railto Beach, the Hoh Rainforest, and ventured south to Pacific Beach and camped in the fog and had a fire on the beach.

                We had a blast and we were very sorry to see them go.  Other things I have been doing for fun the last few weeks are mostly just visiting with friends and family and watching baseball.  I also spent a large portion of time calling Senators offices and watching a very frightening health care bill thankfully meet its (hopefully final) end.  Other things going on in my life:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>I've been very sweaty lately.  It's been hotter than a tin roof in Arkansas here in the PNW.</li>
                <li><br /></li>
                <li>Bought tickets to the <a href=https://www.hihowareyou.com/shows>Daniel Johnston + Built to Spill</a> show in Portland.  I'm pretty excited about that.</li>
                <li><br /></li>
                <li>Still trying to apply all my mindfulness practices in daily life.  Trying to regularly meditate and be as mindful as possible in all my interactions.</li>
                <li><br /></li>
                <li>Speaking of that, I need to do more yoga!</li>
                <li><br /></li>
                <li>Enjoying life with <a href=https://www.instagram.com/__coopdog__/>Cooper!</a>  He is so smart and has been such a blessing for me.  He cheers me up when I'm down.  He gets my ass out of bed and gets me outside even if I'm feeling like shit.  He loves us just as much as we love him.</li>
                <li><br /></li>
                <li>I started keeping a daily journal on an app on my phone.  I love this blog, and as much as I love all your kind comments about it, I've selfishly found that writing about my feelings and reflecting on my experiences has been really theraputic for me.  So I'm going to write more for myself daily!</li>
                <li><br /></li>
                <li>Go see Dunkirk.  It was very, very good.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                On the cancer front, things could be better.  It has now been like 5 weeks or so since I last received any sort of treatment.  You might remember that the chemo stopped working.  Well the last 3 weeks I have been getting poked, prodded, scanned and analyzed to get into this clinical trial.  I think and hope this will be a good route for me but the waiting to get in has been difficult.  I understand the scientific process and I understand the need for all this testing before I go on trial, but sometimes I just want to stand up and say "Hello!  I'm a human with a cancer that is getting bigger every day.  This waiting game isn't doing me any favors.  Please give me the drugs!"  Oh well, the hope is that in a week or so (fingers crossed) I will be randomized into a test arm and start getting infusions.  The crummy part is that immunotherapy takes longer to see any effectiveness, so there will still be a waiting game to start feeling better.
            </p>

                While all this is happening, I can feel this mutant ball of evil growing inside my chest.  Swallowing has progressively been more difficult.  It is at the junction of my stomach and esophagus so I have increasingly had some bad stomach pain.  Thankfully it isnt so bad and I can medicate with some Tylenol and Prilosec.  This difficulty to swallow has caused me to start losing some weight again.  Right now eating is my prime derective.  The one good thing is my chemo symptoms are basically totally gone now.  They stuck around for about a month, but I can finally taste again.  I do know there is still some chemo in me though because my pee still looks like Mountain Dew, but otherwise, everything seems back to normal.
            </p>

                Been thinking a lot about this cancer journey.  A Kurt Vile song came up on shuffle this week and this verse summed up a lot of what I'm thinking lately:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Then I woke up one morning</li>
                <li>Didn't recognize the man in the mirror</li>
                <li>Then I laughed and said, "Oh silly me, that's just me"</li>
                <li>Then I proceeded to not comb some stranger's hair</li>
                <li>Never was my style</li>
                <li>But I couldn't tell you what the hell it was supposed to mean</li>
                <li>Cause it was a Monday, no, a Tuesday</li>
                <li>No, a Wednesday, Thursday, Friday</li>
                <li>Then Saturday came around and I said</li>
                <li>"Who's this stupid clown blocking the bathroom sink?"</li>
                <li>But he was sporting all my clothes</li>
                <li>I gotta say, pretty pimpin'</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                Sometimes I stand in front of the mirror in the morning and it doesn't feel like me looking back.  Here are some thoughts that sometimes run through my mind in no particular order.
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>This guy is skinny as hell.  I've lost 70 lbs in the last 7 months.  I haven't been at this weight since high school... early high school.  My face looks gaunt.  I can see my ribs and bones sticking out.  This is weird</li>
                <li>That is a weird patchy beard you've got there buddy.</li>
                <li>Goddamn this dude's hair is thin.</li>
                <li>Is the guy looking back going to be alive in a year? (Don't get me wrong, my spirits are strong, I'm fighting like hell, but to say I never think about my own mortality would be lying.  This is a really bizarre thing to contemplate.)</li>
                <li>Will this guy's life ever get back on track?  A year ago, Cristina and I were planning all our trips this year.  I was going to find a job.  We were going to raft a river over the 4th of July.  We were going to Wyoming to hike and revel in the upcoming eclipse.  We were going to Europe for a friend's wedding and to travel some new spots in Eastern Europe.  We were going to visit friends in Houston.  We were going to pay off all our debts and have some money in the bank.  Instead this entire year has been consumed with the singular task or keeping me alive.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                So that's where my mind has been lately.  Mom don't read too into this.  I am not depressed or down.  I'm happy and uplifted every day by the love I get from Cristina, my family, friends, strangers, and Cooper, but sometimes these thoughts creep in when I'm looking at my foreign reflection in the mirror.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since I haven't written for a few weeks, I'll leave you with a few songs I've been listening to recently.
