            <p><em>Cancer update #9</em></p>

            <p>
                Another great off-chemo week for me. I am feeling stronger every day. I can eat anything with relatively
                no trouble. Last week I went to yoga the day after I got disconnected and while I was a little shakey at
                times I made it through the entire class. The chemo makes me feel terrible when I am connected but I
                haven't needed any of the meds for side effects when I am off the pump. The only lingering side effects
                I have are neuropathy in my fingers that only comes around when they get cold, so I usually just walk
                around with some gloves on if I am walking outside.
            </p>

            <p>
                I don't have much else to say regarding my cancer process so the rest of this entry is about things I've
                been thinking about and doing this week. Our mindfulness class is winding down, and last weekend I
                participated in an all day retreat. This was a really interesting experience: we were silent pretty much
                the entire time and we meditated and did yoga and some other excercises. It was an interesting and
                unique experience and I am really glad that I went, even though it seemed a little strange going into
                it. In class this week, we talked about these 10 rules for being a human:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>You will receive a body</li>
                <li>You will learn lessons</li>
                <li>There are no mistakes, only lessons</li>
                <li>A less on is repeated until learned</li>
                <li>Learning lessons does not end</li>
                <li>"There" is no better than "here"</li>
                <li>Others are merely mirrors of you</li>
                <li>What you make of your life is up to you</li>
                <li>Your answers lie inside you</li>
                <li>You will forget all this</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Old Joe would have looked at this list and chuckled that it sounded like some silly platitudes but I'm
                trying to not be such a cynic, and I can't stop thinking about a few of these rules.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>YOU WILL RECEIVE A BODY.</strong> I'm especially cognizant of this one, as right now my body is
                not operating at peak performance. In the past I haven't taken the best care of my body. I've always
                enjoyed good food that can be unhealthy, and I've always enjoyed a night out with friends and beers. Now
                I'm playing catch up, and I actually feel really good. I'm resolved to get my body in as good a shape as
                I possibly can.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>THERE ARE NO MISTAKES, ONLY LESSONS.</strong> I've been thinking about this one a lot since
                class. I feel like I've made some big mistakes in my life, but they have taught me some great lessons. I
                dropped out of school, and at the time felt like a giant idiot, but it really taught me what I want from
                life and education and helped me be more assertive (although sometimes I still struggle with
                assertiveness). Now I wish I could be in school for the rest of my life, there is so much to learn.
                Another is that I've been a bad friend (hopefully only) occasionally. This is important to me because I
                value loyalty and love in my friendships, and sometimes I get it wrong. I think I always learn a lesson
                from this and I'll always be working on being a better friend.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>A LESSON IS REPEATED UNTIL LEARNED.</strong> This is especially true in my relationship with
                Cristina. I've learned a bunch of lessons about being a better partner and person, and sometimes I have
                to learn those lessons a few times. Luckily I found someone who is kind and forgiving and understanding
                and patient. I'm also lucky in that she is open to learning lessons as well, and I think were both
                learning a ton from this cancer process.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>YOUR ANSWERS LIE INSIDE YOU.</strong> This is a rule I constantly am struggling with. Sometimes
                I've found it easier to blame others for mistakes (lessons) that I've had to learn. It can sometimes
                take time for me to come around and realize that the solution is always something I can try to change
                within myself.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>YOU WILL FORGET ALL THIS.</strong> Duh. I forget this shit all the time. It's nice to get a
                reminder every once in awhile.
            </p>

            <p>
                Speaking of Cristina, we celebrated our 9 year anniversary this week. We had a staycation at the <a
                    href=https://www.salishlodge.com />Salish Lodge.</a> It was super relaxing. I can't believe how
                lucky I've been to spend the last 9 years with Cristina. It has been the best &#8531; of my life. We've
                been together since I lived with a bunch of smelly dudes in Bellingham. We made it through two years
                apart when I went to school in Wyoming and she started her career in California. We made it through
                another two apart while I worked in Houston and she worked in SF. We started a new life here in Seattle
                and we're beating this cancer together. I can't wait to keep exploring life and this beautiful planet
                with her.

                Got chemo next week! Let's keep killing this cancer. My friend Brett and his fianc√© Hanna are back from
                a <a href=https://www.instagram.com/quarterlifesabbatical />crazy trip</a> and he will be my chemo buddy
                this week. Glad to have them back in the PNW!

                I can't stop listening to the new Kendrick Lamar. This song fills my &#9825;.
