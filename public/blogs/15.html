            <p><em>Cancer update #11</em></p>

            <p>
                Off-chemo week #4. This was a pretty good week. My chemo symptoms lasted a little longer than previous
                weeks. I think that was more a product of me getting disconnected really late on Thursday than anything
                else because once they went away I felt fantastic. Yesterday I did a solo hike up <a
                    href=http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/mailbox-peak>Mailbox Peak</a> out off I90. I was a little
                nervous because it was going to be the most strenuous activity I have done since I started chemo. I've
                also lost a bunch of weight: mostly fat but definitely some muscle mass as well. I've kind of got
                chicken legs now. I threw my backpacking pack on for a little extra challenge. It was a great hike but I
                got socked in at the top and didn't have any views. This is what it looked like up top:

                It actually started to get socked in at the final, most strenuous push. I had a bit of neuropathy in my
                legs and I thought about turning back but I really wanted to get to the top. I had a little note I
                wanted to leave at the mailbox. I wrote <strong>"Yo, I have cancer and I made it to the top of this damn
                    mountain. I'll be back again soon. -Joe"</strong> I made a snap story of the hike. I got an annual
                discovery pass and I can't wait to get out and explore more PNW beauty on every chemo off week this
                summer... hopefully I can keep my strength up.

                Earlier this week we had a great time celebrating Andy's graduation from law school. His girlfriend,
                Kimberly, threw an awesome party at their place and it was really nice to see so many great friends and
                family. Mike came down from Bellingham, and Dan drove up from Portland to join in. There was a keg and a
                pi&#241ata filled with shooters, so we had a decent time. Andy is awesome. He killed it in law school
                and has a really earnest heart for serving the most vulnerable folks in the community. There's a lot of
                good history in my family of attourneys fighting for social justice and he is going to continue that.
                His conviction is inspiring. I can't wait to watch him in court someday! The world needs more Andys.
                What a lucky thing it is to have brothers.

                As I was hiking up that mountain, I started out thinking what a brutal irony it was that at that moment
                I felt the healthiest I've felt in years, maybe a decade, all while there was this rotten thing in my
                chest. I got a little sad. But somewhere on the way up I started to remember all the good that has come
                of this. I feel damn good on my off weeks. My understanding on how I need to spend my time on this
                planet is crystal clear. I've never felt so loved by my friends and family. I've rediscovered how good
                it feels to shine that love back. I got to the top, standing in the rain with the wind and clouds
                swirling around me with my note in my hand and my heart felt full and resolved. I felt lucky to be on
                this earth, and it was good.
