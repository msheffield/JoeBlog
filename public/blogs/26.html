            <p>
                Well the last two weeks have brought some difficulty, some decent news, and some fun times on the life
                front. Cristina, Cam and I just returned from Tennessee! We went to Nashville and Memphis. I made a
                little video of the trip you can watch here:
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>
                The trip was awesome! I love the south. I loved living there and I love visiting. The food is the best
                and everyone is so friendly. We went to the Hawks game and my uncle Lee hooked us up with his family's
                tailgate. We had a blast. The game itself didn't go our way but I loved that we were there to cheer on
                our boys on the day of the big anthem protests. The Hawks and Titans both did not come out for the
                anthem. The anthem singer actually took a knee which was cool! The crowd was very supportive and gave
                both teams a nice big cheer when they finally emerged. It felt really important. The protests were
                extremely patriotic and respectful. I saw a bit of histrionics on Facebook & Twitter: fans burning
                jerseys and season tickets and whatnot, but there was mostly support in that stadium. There are few
                things more insidious than blind nationalism, and hopefully those fans can one day confront their
                fragility and see these protests for what they are. The day they get as upset about a murdered 12 year
                old in Cleveland as they do for a knee during the flag will be a great day for this country.

            <p>
                Other highlights of the trip included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Nashville hot chicken! Holy hell guys, this stuff is hot. We went to Prince's, which is apparently
                    the birthplace of hot chicken. The heat levels go plain, mild, medium, hot, xhot, and xxxhot. I
                    ordered "hot" and Cristina and Cam got the medium. I honestly can't fathom anything above the "hot"
                    level! It was ridiculous. Needless to say I think this is the sort of meal you get once to say you
                    did, then don't eat it ever again!</li>
                <li>Broadway Street in Nashville. This is where all the famous honky tonks are. We had some fun walking
                    around. Bama was in town playing Vandy, so the place was swarming with Hawk fans, Bama fans, and
                    bachelorette parties. It was sort of a mess so we walked over the beautiful pedestrian bridge and
                    took in the city.</li>
                <li>BBQ! As a lover of Texas style BBQ, I was eager to try Memphis style and it did not disappoint. Our
                    first stop was a little shack run by Helen, one of the only female pitmasters in the south. It was
                    amazing and we signed her out of towners book. People from all over the world come to try her
                    chopped pork sandwiches. We also got our fill of ribs at Central BBQ in Memphis. They were
                    incredible as well.</li>
                <li>Beale Street. We had a great time sipping beers and listening to some great local blues. We were
                    there on a Monday and Tuesday so it wasn't as lively as usual but I loved Memphis and Beale Street
                    nontheless.</li>
                <li>The Sun Studios tour. This was recommended to us by our good friend Scott and it didn't disappoint.
                    Sun Studios is sort of the birthplace of Rock and Roll really. Elvis got his start there along with
                    countless others, and the studio is basically unchanged in the last 65 years. The tour consisted of
                    us and about 20 others all over the age of 50.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Also, our Memphis Airbnb was a block away from the National Civil Rights Museum and the Lorraine Motel.
                This is the motel where Martin Luther King Jr. was assasinated. It was very powerful and sad to stand at
                that spot. Overall I loved Memphis and the history of the city.
            </p>

            <p>
                Life keeps going forward on the cancer front. The immunotherapy I am on makes me very, very fatigued.
                The trip was especially exhausting for me but I tried to push through. It was hot and I had to take lots
                of breaks and rest, but I think we did most of what we wanted to do. We got a bit of good news yesterday
                before getting my fourth infusion. There is a cancer marker in the blood called CEA (Carcinoembryonic
                Antigen). This number should be zero in cancer free people. When I was first diagnosed, my number was in
                the 300s. It got down below 100 while I was on chemo until the chemo stopped working. Well over the last
                few months, by CEA has shot up to over 1000. Just ridiculously high! But, over the last two treatments,
                the number has reduced by about 25%! This is decent news. Hopefully a scan can confirm that this
                immunotherapy is doing something good.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm getting by with rest, trying to eat to keep on weight, I'm still meditating, and the messages of
                support and help from friends and family. Thank you all for the amazing support you give to Cristina and
                I. We love y'all.
            </p>

            <p>
                We listened to a lot of The Fucking Champs on our trip so I'll leave you with one of my favorites!
