            <p><em>Cancer update #4</em></p>

            <p>
                Lots of emotions this week but I would say my big three were: disappointment, relief, and love. The
                events of this week actually started last week, as I started to experience <em>extreme</em> fatigue. I
                was getting winded walking around the block with my folk's new <a
                    href=https://www.instagram.com/youngcalvin17 />puppy.</a> I thought maybe it was just because I have
                cancer, which turned out to be half true.
            </p>

            <p>
                Monday was going to be a big day, I had appointments all day to get me ready to go on this clinical
                trial. First up was some bloodwork, and a meeting with the PA for my oncologist. Well it turns out the
                bloodwork indicated I was <em>severly</em> low on my red blood cell count. Turns out my tumor has been
                bleeding inside my chest. The trial I was going to be on has a minimum red blood cell count to enter,
                and I was well below it. If I was going to start the trial, I would need a blood transfusion that
                afternoon to try and get me above the threshold. This was my first blood transfusion, and my first time
                in the infusion center at SCCA. Its a pretty comfy spot to get infusions. Here I am getting the blood:

            <p>
                Tuesday we came in ready to start the chemo/immunotherapy on the trial, but it turns out the blood
                transfusion really didn't do too much. I've got a real bleeder in there. So now we needed to make some
                tough choices. I could keep getting blood transfusions trying to get my blood count up, with no
                guarentee that it would get there, and delay my treatment. Or, I could start standard treatment that
                day, and forget this clinical trial. After weeks of psyching myself up for the trial, this was a punch
                in the gut.
            </p>

            <p>
                After some thoughtful deliberation with my oncologist and my fam, we decided to get me started on the
                standard chemo. There will hopefully be more options down the road for immunotherapy, but it seemed
                important to start trying to shrink this tumor ASAP and get the bleeding under control. So that was
                that. I made my way up to the infusion center for the second day in a row to begin treatment and get two
                more units of blood.
            </p>

            <p>
                This was a long day. I am on <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOLFOX>FOLFOX,</a> which means a few
                hours of infusion with the Folinic acid and the Oxaliplatin, and then I get to take home a pump that
                slowly gives me the 5-FU, through my chest port, over a period of 46 hours. It was not the end of the
                world though, check out all these snacks I got!
            </p>

                I also made a little Snap story of my afternoon there.

                So as I write this blog, I'm feeling pretty good. I was disconnected from the 5-FU yesterday and boy is
                it nice to not have a beeping fanny pack connected to my chest to carry around all day. The chemo made
                me tired and nauseaus and gave me a heinous taste in my mouth, but it could be worse.
            </p>

                I'll wrap this up by coming back to those emotions that dominated this week. This week I was
                disappointed that I won't be on that trial I was pretty excited about. This week I was releived that I
                was finally starting the big drugs to try and beat this thing in my chest. Most importantly this week I
                felt loved. I felt loved by everyone that sent me an email or text on Tuesday as I was getting the
                chemicals. I felt loved by my family who sat with me as I was getting the mediocre news and the bad
                drugs. I also felt love from the anonymous folks that donated their blood for me to use. I'll never be
                able to repay that, as my own blood is tainted now, but thank you anonymous person with the good blood.

                Been feeling emo all week and listening to The Hotelier a lot.
