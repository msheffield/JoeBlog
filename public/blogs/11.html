            <p><em>Cancer update #7</em></p>

            <p>
                This has been a great non-chemo week for me and given me lots of stuff to write about. Bookkeeping note:
                I added a "subscribe" button to the blog. Cristina says there are people that read this that I am not
                Facebook/Twitter friends with and don't get my update when I write something, so if y'all want an email
                when I post something new that is awesome too! You can unsubscribe any time. I won't use your email to
                sign you up for cat facts either, I promise.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'll start off by saying I feel pretty great. I have been able to get to the gym, my chemo symptoms went
                away after Monday, I am eating and swallowing better, I don't think my tumor is bleeding anymore because
                I have a ton more energy. This means I was able to do a bunch of cool stuff this week. Radiohead on
                Saturday was amazing. Had a great time hanging out with Evan and Lauren beforehand as well. Followed
                that up Sunday with a great BBQ at Eddie's.
            </p>

            <p>
                Monday a big group of us went to the Mariners home opener, which they won! We tried the new fried
                grasshopper they are serving and I thought they were actually really good! Cristina was not as big a
                fan. Here is a little video from the afternoon at the game. This includes us eating grasshopper and
                going bonkers at the last out like the M's had just won the World Series. Most know this, but I have a
                history of bringing awful luck to my favorite sports teams when I attend. I love going to Seahawks away
                games and have never seen them win, and I hadn't witnessed a Mariners win in person in years, despite
                going to dozens of games in Seattle and Houston and Oakland. Some friends from Houston even bought
                Cristina and I tickets last season when the Astros were in town partially because they wanted my bad
                luck at the game, haha. So anyways, the Mariners are 1-0 this season at games I have attended!

                Cristina and I also did some trivia at <a href=http://www.ravennabrewing.com />Ravenna Brewing</a> and
                came in second. Wednesday I did a bunch of work and Alyssa brought her dog over for me to hang out with.
                Dogs are the best therapy. King is a great snuggler.

                A few weeks ago I met with a genetic counselor and we decided that it would be best if I was screened
                for a bunch of mutations that could help explain why I got this cancer at such a young age. This won't
                really influence <em>my</em> treatment, but if I have the mutations then my bros could get tested and
                plan their screening accordingly. Well we found out that my insurance denied paying for the testing, but
                thankfully SCCA has a deal with a biotech in the bay called <a href=https://www.color.com />Color
                Genomics</a> that will run a 30 gene panel for free for me. This is awesome, and also neat because it
                turns out that Cristina helped do a bit of consulting for them back in the day. Very cool.

                I've been thinking a bunch this week about how my overall philosophy has changed since this diagnosis.
                I'm a 30 year old with Stage IV Esophageal cancer with metastaces in 1 or 2 places. Statistically, the
                numbers for my long term survival are not good. Now that that is out of the way, I will say I'm
                operating under the assumption that those numbers won't apply to me because the average age for EC is
                65-70, and I am a relatively healthy 30 year old. I'm doing everything I possibly can to make sure those
                numbers don't apply to me. <em>BUT,</em> statistically, my lifespan has been dramatically shortened.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm mostly the same Joe, but I have really actively been trying to change how I live my life. Lots of
                things have been really helpful to me but my mindfulness class has been especially helpful. Here is a
                short list of ways I am trying to live my life differently in the face of my own mortality:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Say yes more. Pre-cancer, I sometimes would turn down fun opportunities or interesting experiences
                    because I was lazy or procrastinated too long. Now I want to cram as much as I possibly can into
                    whatever time I feel healthy because this life is too short to say no all the time.</li>
                <li>Accellerate my bucket list. This kind of ties in with the first item, but while I'm feeling healthy,
                    I'm going to fill my time by accomplishing as many life goals as possible. I've got a ton of hiking
                    I want to do, new places I want to visit or old places I want to visit again, things to learn. I
                    want to learn how to scuba dive. I'm continuing to teach myself how to be a better cook, and I have
                    a ton of recipes in the queue to make. I've got tons of professional web development stuff I want to
                    learn and am currently teaching myself.</li>
                <li>Expressing my feelings better and more often. See: this blog.</li>
                <li>Expressing my appreciation and love better and more frequently. Also sort of goes with the above
                    item, but especially now I want to be really good at letting people know how gobsmacked I am by all
                    the love and caring myself and my family has been shown. I've been flooded with emails, notes,
                    homemade food, visits, positive thoughts/prayers and overall love and friendship, and I'm trying to
                    be really good at shining that love back when I receive it. I also want to say I love you more
                    often.</li>
                <li>Not getting worked up about politics as often. Those that know me know this is a tough one, but
                    right now, I'm mostly putting my love/hate relationship with politics on the back burner while I
                    enjoy things that genuinely make me happy.</li>
                <li>Finally, not being as cynical. I was always fairly cynical, I don't think I am as much after this
                    whole experience. I'm trying to live my life in a more positive and open minded way. I'm trying
                    things I never would have done before. I'm doing yoga, I'm meditating, I'm writing about my
                    feelings. It all feels pretty good.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Anyways, this has been a long blog. I'll leave you with some tunes I've been listening to this week.
                Have you heard the new <a href=https://pile.bandcamp.com />Pile</a> album? It is so good. My favorite of
                2017 so far. This song kicks ass.
