            <p><em>Cancer update #10</em></p>

            <p>
                Well this is my 10th cancer blog, time really flies. I had my fourth round of chemo this week. I've
                noticed that the first couple days when I have the take home pump I feel pretty mediocre, but the last
                day (Thursday) when I get disconnected, I feel like absolute shit. The chemo totally saps me of energy
                and the taste it gives me in my mouth makes eating really not enjoyable. But it's all worth it if it's
                killing the cancer. My friend Brett came and hung out with Cristina and I this week which was awesome,
                thanks Brett! Here's a little snippet from the day:

                Last weekend Cristina and I went up to Bellingham to see some friends and fam. An old friend of Cristina
                from Hawaii and her husband are amazing photographers and took some really nice photos of Cristina and I
                out in the woods. I'm glad we did this because my hair is starting to fall out and I think my giant head
                would look a little silly bald in the photos. Thank you so much Angela and Domi! If you are ever in need
                of a good photographer, check out <a

                I also got some snuggle time with their hilarious kids and we watched a movie. Did you know there are
                sequels to The Brave Little Toaster? Well there are. We watched <a

                Being home is also nice because I can get snuggles from my folk's new dog. He is an adorable fluffball
                and really makes me happy.

                We had our last mindfulness class this Wednesday. The last two months of classes were really helpful for
                me. It has really helped put things in perspective and to give me some different tools to help with
                dealing with difficult situations. The meditation and yoga have been wonderful, and Cristina and I
                always have good things to talk about after class. This week we discussed what we were taking away from
                the class and how we were going to continue being mindful going forward. I think the most helpful things
                for me are the meditation and yoga, as well as trying to be more mindful of how I interact with others:
                I want to be able to give and accept love in a more mindful and purposeful way. The biggest thing I am
                taking away from the class is to just take each moment and each day as it comes. Life is too short to
                spend it being stressed out about life.

                Finally, I spent a large portion of the week calling various Washington Republican Representatives and
                urging them to vote NO on the latest health care bill. I'm very scared about this bill and what it will
                mean for me. I am on Obamacare. I have a pre-existing condition. It would suck to not be able to afford
                to buy my own insurance and to not be able to be covered by a future employer's insurance plan. I just
                hope this whole debacle leads to single payer health care in America, and I hope I live to see it. Thats
                about all the politics I'm going to talk in this blog. If you feel so inclined, call your Senators and
                tell them to vote NO.

                Been listening to a bunch of old music this week. Jawbreaker has been on heavy rotation. I love this
                song.
