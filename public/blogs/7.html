            <p>
                This was a great week for me. Some friends were in Seattle last friday so a bunch of us went and threw
                some <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y81gbOJi1w>rocks</a>. My chemo port is in my right
                shoulder, so after one roll, I quickly realized that bowling wasn't a good idea for me. I enjoyed the
                rest of the night just hanging out and laughing at my friends bowling. It was a great time. Thanks Steve
                and Josh for driving down from Bellingham!
            </p>

            <p>
                Saturday Cristina and I hung out at Eddie's and played <a href=http://www.secrethitler.com />Secret
                Hitler</a> and drank wine. Nate and Callie were there and it was so great to see them. Tuesday we did
                trivia with Ashgan, Marissa, Evan, and Lauren and had a great time.
            </p>

            <p>
                On the cancer front I got some good news. I found out my tumor is positive for the <a
                    href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PD-L1>PD-L1</a> protein. This means I will be in a <a
                    href=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT02494583>clinical trial</a> and hopefully receive
                the drug <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembrolizumab>Pembro</a>. Since Cristina understands this
                stuff much better than I do, she found this nice video that explains what these PD-L1 inhibitors are
                trying to do.
            </p>

            <div class="videowrapper">
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aobxYfY-8p0"></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>
                There are three arms to the trial, one arm with the normal chemo and a placebo, one arm with the normal
                chemo and the pembro, and a third arm with just the pembro. Fingers crossed I fall into the arm with
                both.
            </p>

            <p>How I'm feeling about the trial:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Nervous to start chemo.</li>
                <li>Excited I get to try a new drug with promising results.</li>
                <li>Scared about falling into the arm without the Pembro.</li>
                <li>Excited to start chemo.</li>
                <li>Terrified about falling into the arm without the chemo.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                But these are scary times in general and I trust my doctors. This trial seems like a great thing to be
                in. I have always romanticized the old exploreres and pioneers, so I'm choosing to think of myself in
                this trial as sort of a medical pioneer!
            </p>

            <p>
                Lastly, I had a CT scan on Wednesday. I have been giving myself injections of blood thinners because, on
                my last CT scan, they found a blood clot in my lung. This is no bueno, but can be common in cancer
                patients. Well this week's CT scan showed that the blood clot is no longer visible, so the blood
                thinners are working!
            </p>

            <p>
                Cristina and I had our first <a href=http://www.mindfulnessnw.com />Mindfulness Based Stress
                Reduction</a> class this week. I think the tools I can learn in this class are going to be really
                helpful for me. We practiced meditation, did a "body scan", and discussed living more mindfully in
                everything from how we react emotionally to how we taste food. I left feeling uplifted and calm.
            </p>

            <p>
                The hardest part of my life right now continues to be swallowing food and liquids. I have lost 50 pounds
                since I moved to Seattle, and probably 35-40 of those pounds have been in the last three months. Keeping
                my calories up is a daily struggle, and I hope that I won't have to get a feeding tube.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'll leave you with a couple older songs bringing me good vibes this week. The first needs a little
                explanation. I love to sing while I hike (don't ask why, I just do), and this song has always been a
                favorite hiking song of mine. This song also tickles my sense of exploration as I think about this
                clinical trial I'm entering.
            </p>

            <p>
                This last one just makes me smile and gets me fired up, and I've been listening to The Mountain Goats a
                bunch this week.
