            <p><em>Cancer update #21</em></p>

            <p>
                I am writing this blog lying in a bed at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. It has been a busy few weeks for
                me. Full of lots of ups and downs. Honestly it's been a tough few weeks but I'm getting through with the
                help of my doctors, my friends, Cristina, and my amazing family.
            </p>

            <p>
                My last entry I couldn't swallow food and barely drink liquid. This quickly came to a head and my
                doctors and I decided that it was time to place a stent in my esophagus. What the hell is a stent and
                why would they put one in your esophagus? I found this funny video that helps explain what it is. Enjoy
                the video and the amazing soundtrack:
            </p>

            <div class="videowrapper">

            </div>

            <p>
                So basically I can swallow food more better now! I've been eating regular food, and I can eat at a
                pretty decent clip now. Anyone that knows my family knows we are fast eaters, so I still finish a little
                behind, but at least now I don't have to schedule 2 hours for dinner. I woke up from the procedure and
                promptly threw up a stomachful of blood, and I had to spend the night in the hospital, but it was worth
                it to be able to eat.
            </p>

            <p>
                The stent is not without a few longer term issues though. Since my tumor is at the junction of my
                stomach and my esophagus, I basically have a permanent opening there now. This means I am having some
                serious issues with acid reflux. I had to buy a wedge to sleep on, but that was uncomfortable as hell so
                instead we have put the head of our bed on risers. Thank you Cristina for sleeping with your head
                elevated to help me out. I'm also on about 15 different reflux medications. The combination of all this
                has been pretty helpful but I still get a little uncomfortable occasionally.
            </p>

            <p>
                So why am I lying in bed at SCCA you might ask? I'm getting my third expiremental immunotherapy
                treatment today! So far it has gone pretty well, with no side effects from the drugs. We are not sure if
                there have been any positive side effects either though, as I have not yet had a scan. I did have
                another endoscopy to biopsy the tumor this week. It was my fifth endoscopy since my diagnosis and I'm
                getting to be a pro. They really aren't that bad and they give you some fun anesthesia, so to anyone out
                there reading this blog, if you have bad reflux or a family history of cancer, don't forget to get your
                endoscopies!
            </p>

            <p>
                The other big news in our lives is that we moved a little ways across town this week. Leaving Fremont
                was tough. I will miss the troll and the statue of Lenin. I'll miss the farmer's market and all the fun
                little shops and bars. But we've moved to Ravenna and I can't wait to explore this new part of this
                awesome city I live in. We are in a house now with Andy and Kimberly. It is really nice to be closer to
                them, as they have been such an incredible support to Cristina and I going through this cancer thing,
                and Coop loves them.
            </p>

            <p>
                So that's all the big news for us from the last few weeks. This is how I've been feeling these last few
                weeks:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Grateful: This move was hard, and I am weak as hell. I can lift a box or two and then I get winded
                    and have to sit down and rest or I start feeling like shit. Cristina works all day and would come
                    home and work like crazy to move our little life across town. My fam was super helpful coming down
                    and helping. Thank you mom and dad! And we had some help from our great friends. Thank you so much
                    Ashgan and Cam. I am grateful to have these amazing people there to step up to help out.</li>
                <li>Scared: Is this new treatment working? Now that I have a stent, I can't really use my ability to
                    swallow as a guage for how the treatment is working. Now I just have to cross my fingers and wait
                    until my next scan. My doctor says this is kind of a pivitol time, and if the immunotherapy isn't
                    having positive affects we will have to move on to some harsh chemo as the next treatment.</li>
                <li>Proud: There were a couple achievments for people I love these last couple weeks. Andy passed the
                    bar! That is awesome and I am super excited for him and can't wait to see what his next step is. We
                    also were able to go up to Bellingham last weekend and be there for my dad's retirement speech at
                    his office party. He built up an amazing practice and is an inspiration for what hard work can
                    achieve. Dad I hope you enjoy the hell out of some more free time for projects! I love you both very
                    much.</li>
                <li>Excited: Cristina and I are going on a date tonight! Gonna go grab dinner at one of our favorite
                    restaurants and then catch the Fleet Foxes show! Fleet Foxes was one of the first shows we went to
                    damn near 10 years ago. I lived in a gross party house in Bellingham and the show was right up the
                    street at the WWU PAC concert hall. It was cold and we held hands in the kangaroo pocket of my
                    sweater. The show was amazing. I'm excited to have another date with the most wonderful girl in the
                    world.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                So thats whats up with us these past few weeks. Been listening to a lot of good music so I'll put a
                couple down here. This Julien Baker song is really hitting me lately.
