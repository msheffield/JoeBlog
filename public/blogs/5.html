            <p><em>Cancer update #1</em></p>

            <p>
                Ok so this week was a tiring one. I met with my oncologist on Monday and she, and the entire facility at
                <a href=https://www.seattlecca.org />Seattle Cancer Care Alliance</a> are amazing. It is basically one
                stop shopping for cancer treatment: just take the elevator from floor to floor and you have everything
                you need. It is also in a gorgeous location down on Eastlake. A nice, comforting setting to get
                uncomfortable news and have uncomfortable chemicals pumped through your body.
            </p>

            <p>
                Wednesday I had a PET scan to find out if any of the possible metastases were from the big guy in my
                esophagus. This was my first PET scan. Basically, they bring you into a nice, comfy room, and the nurse
                walks in with a giant lead lined syringe. They inject you with a radioactive tracer that cancer seems to
                like. Then you lie in a big tube for 45 minutes while they slowly scan you. About 20 minutes into the
                scan apparently I had fallen asleep because I woke myself up with a loud snore. Maybe I'm more at peace
                than I thought or maybe I was just exhausted.
            </p>

            <p>
                Anyways, at least one of the metastases is related to the esophageal tumor, so the plan is no surgery
                and to try and get everything with chemo and immunotherapy. On Saturday I will get a port placed in my
                neck so they can easily administer the drugs and take blood and stuff. I also recently had to start self
                injecting blood thinners into the few fatty parts I have left. I realize lots of people have to do this
                all the time but it was a first for me and boy was it weird.
            </p>

                I might have to have this section every week but I'll say it again, the messages and visits and love and
                prayers I've been getting the last week have been overwhelming. Thank you. I couldn't be doing this
                without my friends and family. I especially couldn't be doing this without Cristina. She has been so
                amazing and helpful and I want to say thank you to her friends as well for being there for her. I think
                I can speak for both of us in that we are both feeling very blessed to have y'all in our lives.
            </p>

                Been listening to a lot of music this last week. Here's a song thats been bringing me some smiles:
