            <p><em>Cancer update #24</em></p>

            <p>
                It has been a few weeks since my last blog entry, and these last few weeks have been pretty good! This
                cancer journey has been a roller coaster of going from feeling like death to feeling like a relatively
                normal person every couple months or so. Thankfully right now I am feeling relatively normal.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am currently on the off-chemo week between my second and third cycle of the "Taxol-Ram" chemo I talked
                about in my <a href=http://joemcclenahan.com/blog/27 />last blog post.</a> This new chemo, coupled with
                a timely blood transfusion, has helped me feel a lot better. I am stronger, I am eating more, I am
                keeping the food I eat down, I can walk to the park with Coop and not get winded, I can stand in line at
                the grocery store, and I can cook dinner in the kitchen. These are all things I couldn't do a month or
                so ago and will never take for granted again. My weight still fluctuates but overall I am up like 10lbs
                or so from my lightest, which is awesome!
            </p>

            <p>
                The chemo itself is a lot easier than my first line chemo treatment I was on earlier in the year. They
                give me some funny "pre meds" that help me tolerate the drugs but also give me some interesting side
                effects. The steriod they give me before the chemo has given me some acne that makes me feel like a
                teenager again. I also get a heavy dose of Benadryl that basically puts me to sleep through the whole
                treatment, which is kind of nice. This chemo also gives me neuropathy. This means I make a lot of typos
                typing and have trouble buttoning my pants, so if you find a typo in this post or see me walking around
                with my fly open, I blame my numb fingertips.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thats about all I have for you on the cancer front. I go in next week to start the third round of chemo.
                These rounds are a month long each. I will get scanned again sometime in the beginning of January, so
                fingers crossed we are shrinking this thing again. I will do a better job of keeping y'all updated.
            </p>

            <p>
                This last month has had a lot going on in the life department. Right as I started to get stronger,
                Cristina and I traveled to San Francisco for her birthday to visit friends and family. SF is one of our
                favorite cities not just because of how beautiful it is but because of the people there. We had a great
                birthday dinner with some amazing friends, walked around the beautiful city, and spent some quality time
                with my grandparents. We also had a friend, <a href=http://www.karenling.net />Karen</a>, take some
                photos of Cristina and I that I think turned out pretty great! I am a lucky dude.
            </p>

            <p>
                The next week Cristina, Andrea and myself went and saw Daniel Johnston's farewell tour. I have loved
                Daniel Johnston's music for a long time, and he has influenced a bunch of my favorite bands. He was
                playing with some of the Built to Spill guys as his backup band, which was pretty cool. His voice and
                lyrics are still as heartfelt as ever and he played all the hits. Cristina and I stayed up afterwards
                listening to all our favorite covers of his.
            </p>

                The next week I had chemo and it would have been a normal, boring chemo week, but two of my Aunts came
                to visit! My Aunt Carol flew in from Tuscon and my Aunt Lynn came in from Guatemala/Portland. It was so
                nice to see them. They came to my chemo treatment, we did a cruise around Lake Washington on a friend's
                <a href=http://www.enchantresscruises.com />boat,</a> and had some great family time. This week also
                marked sort of a downer for me. I had been growing my beard out since I was diagnosed. This new chemo
                seemed to be taking direct aim at the beard follicles. I was able to pull out big clumps of beard hair
                and it was getting in all my food and was pretty gross, so I had to shave it. It was traumatic but it's
                nice to see my chin again. Thank you so much Carol and Lynn for visiting! I love you both.

            <p>
                Thanksgiving was last week and we had a great, relaxing weekend with the fam in Bellingham. It was great
                to be home with my folks and brothers. We played a new board game I just got and ate some delicious
                food. I've tried hard to not get jaded over this last year and I have a lot to be thankful for. I am
                thankful to be alive right now. Thankful for the life I've had. Thankful for amazing friends and family
                who still love me when I'm sick and grumpy from cancer and chemo. Thankful to have someone like Cristina
                in my life: a partner that loves me unconditionally. Thankful for Cooper, the best, snuggliest, most
                loving doggo on the planet. Thankful for the incredible team of doctors, nurses, counselors, chaplains,
                nutritionists, receptionists, schedulers, parking lot attendants, and anyone else I am forgetting at
                SCCA that have helped give me a longer life this last year. Thankful I can currently stand in line at
                the grocery store. Thankful I can take Coop on a walk. Thankful I can take trips with Cristina. Thankful
                I can swallow dinner. And probably most importantly, thankful to have a new and better perspective on
                living. I hope y'all had a great and thankful Thanksgiving.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'll wrap this up with some final thoughts on living with this cancer. Cristina and I had a really great
                conversation and a good cry last night about this whole ordeal. It might seem obvious but sometimes the
                thought of me dying can overwhelm us both. It is really scary. I don't want her to be alone. I want her
                to feel loved. Sometimes it can seem easier to get depressed and shut in but we reaffirmed that whatever
                time we have left on this earth is going to be spent chasing amazing experiences and enjoying every
                second we have together. If I can walk on two legs or roll in a wheelchair, we are going to spend that
                time doing the things we love to do, enjoying the company of each other and friends and family, and
                experiencing new things and finding new passions. No negativity, no regrets. I know I have said stuff
                like this before but I like to keep writing it out to hold myself accountable and to remind anyone
                reading this that life is short and fragile and needs to be lived as fully, deeply and purposfully as
                possible.
            </p>

            <p>
                So that is what has been going on in my life! Cristina and I have a ton of little weekend trips planned
                or in the works, and hopefully some longer, more distant travels in the future depending on my health.
                We're taking a ceramics class next month that I am really excited for! My other Aunt and Uncle and some
                cousins are coming in next week and I can't wait to see them. I have not been blogging as regularly but
                I promise to start back up more frequently as it is great therapy for me to write out my thoughts and
                feelings. As always, I've been listening to and discovering good (in my opinion) new music so I'll leave
                you with some choice cuts.
            </p>

            Until I Slowly Do See
            <p><em>Cancer update #23</em></p>

            <p>
                Well, it has been a few weeks since my last blog. I have currently wrapped up a round of three new
                treatments. These last few weeks have been some of the most challenging of my cancer journey thusfar.
            </p>

            <p>
                I say "new treatment" and unfortunately I am not talking about the immunotherapy clinical trial I was
                previously on. Three weeks ago I had my first scan after four rounds of treatment in the clinical trial.
                Sadly, we got some really demoralizing news, again. The treatments were not working. This was a huge
                bummer for me. I had been feeling pretty crummy but also had thought I was noticing some positive
                changes, so I had hope. This bastard in my chest had other ideas though and apparently it had still been
                growing the whole time. After much discussion with my oncologist, we decided to move on to a third line
                of treatment.
            </p>

            <p>
                SCCA is amazing though and no sooner had I been removed from the clinical trial I was getting my first
                infusion of a coctail called "Taxol-Ram." <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paclitaxel>Taxol</a> is
                a pretty standard chemo that is used in lots of different forms of cancer. My mom had it when she was
                beating breast cancer. The <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramucirumab>Ram</a> is interesting, as
                it is actually a different type of immunotherapy. It is often combined with the Taxol in gastric cancers
                like mine. My understanding of how it works is to somehow restrict bloodflow to the tumor and sort of
                suffocate it in a way.
            </p>

            <p>
                Up until this week, I had been feeling super drained. It was a challenge to walk around the block. I'm a
                sack of skin and bones, I don't have much fat left to speak of, so I also get real achy and sore where
                by bones stick out. I seem to have more GI problems than I can keep track of with new ones popping up
                each week. My medicine cabinet is gonna need a renovation at this rate. But all is not lost. I'm still
                hopeful. Hopeful that this new treatment helps out. I got a blood transfusion last week that has really
                given me a boost. I also gained 2 lbs in the last week which is great. Maybe this new treatment is doing
                some good! I would love to continue to get more energy, gain more weight, and maybe go on a light
                fall/winter hike with the girlfriend and the dog.
            </p>

            <p>
                I've been thinking a lot about caregivers recently. This last month has been incredibly hard. I could
                have never gotten through it without my caregiver, Cristina. I couldn't shop for my own groceries, I
                would get tired standing in the kitchen cooking dinner, and I definitely couldn't wait in line at the
                pharmacy for all the pills I need to take. Cristina is the most amazing caregiver and has never waivered
                in helping me live with as much independene and support as possible.
            </p>

            <p>
                Of course I have other caregivers in my life as well! I live with my brother Andy and his amazing
                girlfriend Kimberly who have been nothing but amazing support. My mom and dad, my brother Mike, and my
                extended family are also the most fantastic and supportive caregivers I could ask for. Then I have a
                great group of friends near and far. We had a little Seahawks watch party and some friends came down
                from Bellingham. Caregivers give time and not just physical but emotional support as well, and it was a
                great boost to have some time to hang out with awesome friends. Thanks Steve, Sam, and Rylan for driving
                down and everybody else for stopping by! It was also great to see my cousin Bryan as well!
            </p>

                So I'm dedicating this blog to all my amazing caregivers, and all the other amazing caregivers out
                there. I see them every day at SCCA and read about them in some of the online support groups I belong
                to. I love you all and thank you for helping me fight this shit!
            </p>

            <p>
                Been listening to a ton of great music lately so I'll leave you with a couple of my favorites!
