            <p>
                Well I had chemo this week for the third time. It went as well as it can, I think. My symptoms were
                pretty similar to the first two times but I think I am having more of the cold sensitivity. My buddy Cam
                hung out with me at the infusion clinic for a few hours while I got this week's dose. Thanks Cam! Made a
                little Snapchat story for this week:
            </p>

                I think this time I felt the worst the day I was disconnected from my chemo. It just feels really,
                really draining. You may ask, what does it mean to be disconnected from the chemo? Let me show you! My
                Chemo regimine starts every other Tuesday with a heavy dose of a drug called <a
                    href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxaliplatin>Oxaliplatin.</a> This is combined with some dextrose
                to keep my vein from collapsling. I also get a drug called <a
                    href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folinic_acid>Leucovorin</a> to help to decrease the toxicity of
                the final drug, the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorouracil>5-FU.</a> The Oxaliplatin and
                Leucovorin are infused into me over a two hour period. After that, I get to take home a portable pump,
                with which the 5-FU is infused over a period of 46 hours. The entire time I have a tube coming out of my
                chest port which looks like this:
            </p>

            <div class="blogimg">
                <img src=http://i.imgur.com/yJjkwaA.jpg />
            </div>

            <p>
                The tube is connected to a little fanny pack I get to wear around. It pumps every few minutes or so and
                makes a little noise. It's nice white noise while I try and sleep. It flops around as I try and do yoga
                during our mindfulness classes. It makes me stink since I can't shower with it on for 46 hours. I
                imagine with each little hum of the pump it's whispering <em>"You're killing it bro."</em> These are all
                wonderful, awful, awfully-wonderful drugs that make me feel like shit and kill cancer at the same time.
                Every other Thursday I get to take it off, take a shower, and feel better for a week and a half until it
                starts over.

                The good news is that something is working. My bloodwork looked great this week. Everything in my body
                seems to be working pretty well right now. Swallowing is noticibly easier so I can keep weight on
                better. I have been able to have a beer, something I couldn't do for 3 months or so before I started
                treatment. In two weeks after my next chemo treatment, I will get a scan to actually find out if we are
                killing this cancer, so fingers crossed.

                Other things going on in my life: I am 3-0 in Mariners games I have attended this year. Cristina and I
                were gifted some really great Diamond Club tickets. It was my first time in the Diamond Club and wow, it
                is a cool experience. I am trying to stay as active mentally and physically as I can. I am going to try
                out a yoga studio right around the corner from our apartment. I have a <a
                    href=https://www.raspberrypi.org />Raspberry Pi</a> on the way for me to play around with. I am
                using my Angular experience to teach myself <a href=https://ionicframework.com />Ionic</a> so that I can
                build a nice app for the <a href=https://whatcomhospice.org />Whatcom Hospice.</a> I am trying to live
                each day as fully as I possibly can, and I hope to see you sometime out and about in Seattle or
                Bellingham now that the weather has started to turn beautiful.
