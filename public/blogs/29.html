            <p><em>Cancer update #25</em></p>

            <p>
                Merry Christmas! Happy Holidays! Happy Hanukkah! Happy Kwaanza! Good Solstice if thats what you're into!
                I hope whatever holiday you celebrate this season is full of joy, you are surrounded by the people you
                love, satiated with good food, enveloped in happy memories, and a warmed by a full heart.
            </p>

            <p>
                A little cancer update: I still have it. This was the last week of my third cycle of Taxol-Ram chemo and
                things could be going better. I am feeling great, full of energy and I can happily do most low-medium
                energy things that I want to do. That being said, this last month has also brought back some nagging
                clues that maybe this treatment is starting to slow down its efficacy. I've started to have some
                occasional trouble swallowing, and I can tell that my blood is getting stickier from the tumor marker,
                which is tracked every time I give blood at the lab. This tumor marker got cut in half after the first
                cycle, and has slowly risen the last two months. It currently sits right where I started at three months
                ago. A big bummer.
            </p>

            <p>
                I was supposed to have a scan in the beginning of January but we have moved it up to next week. This
                will be the definitive test to see if the tumor or any of the lesions or lymph nodes are growing. If
                they are, I imagine it will be on to another treatment, although I fear we are running low on options.
                Maybe another immunotherapy? Maybe radiation? I will report more next week after I meet with my
                oncologist. Regardless, there is no way in hell I'm letting this be a downer over the holiday. I can't
                wait to be home in Bellingham, hang out with the fam, see old friends, and just generally surround
                myself with the people I love!
            </p>

            <p>
                I love Christmas. I love to give gifts. Getting older is funny. When I was little I loved getting the
                gifts, now I love to give them. I think when I was a kid I wanted nothing more than to blast through
                December and make it to the 25th as quickly as I can. Now, Cristina and I have been relishing every day.
                I love the lights we've set up. We have had the Christmas station on the car radio all month and I never
                want it off. I've been trying to get Cristina and Coop to sing along with me to the best Christmas song
                ever but haven't been having much luck.
            </p>

                Hopefully this comes up on the radio playlist again this weekend and I can try again. I will keep you
                updated. Two weeks ago, the Welch fam came to town and we went Christmas tree picking! It was so good to
                see them, and wonderful of them to come all the way from NYC and Denver just to hang. Love you guys.
                Anyways, we had a great time finding the best, crookedest Christmas tree and decorating the hell out of
                it. We put so many ornaments on it that it collapsed the next day but don't worry, it is standing again.
                Afterwards my pops and Brendan made my dad's famous pizza. It was a great weekend.

            <p>
                Last weekend Cristina and I took a spa weekend to the Cle Elum/Roslyn area of Washington at Suncadia. I
                got this for her for her birthday a couple months ago. It was super fun and relaxing. Roslyn is an
                awesome little coal mining town that we explored, and we got hot river rock massages at the spa. I am
                super ticklish though so that might be my last massage... I dunno. Also last Sunday we went to the Hawks
                game. Thank you Cam for the tickets, but I think I won't speak anything more of that game. The final big
                thing that happened last week was Andy was officially sworn in as a lawyer! We all went down to the
                courthouse and watched him recite a very long oath in front of a very nice judge. The courtroom was a
                little funky in that the seating area was seperated from the court area by a giant, obtrusive glass
                wall, so we didn't get many good pictures. It was awesome though and I can't wait for Andy to find his
                dream job and start lawyerin.
            </p>

            <p>
                Probably one of my favorite things about Christmastime is Christmas cards. I love to look at all the
                cards we get and my parents get and read about everyone's year. I also love to send out our own.
                Cristina and I have been doing it since 2010. I'm sure our current President would be amazed to find out
                that this secular liberal and his girlfriend have been telling the people they love "Merry Christmas"
                for at least the last 8 years. We must have missed the Obama "no Merry Christmas" memo. We brainstorm
                all year with ideas for that year's card. We currently have a bunch in the hopper right now just waiting
                to be made. Cristina is the photoshop wizard that makes them look amazing. I just dress up and look
                goofy and write messages to all our friends and family. It is a blast. Recently I threw them all online,
                so I think I'll run through them up until this year.
            </p>

            <h2>2010</h2>

            <div class="blogimg">

            </div>

            <p>
                Our first attempt and a classic. Cristina wore an ugly sweater and I raided Goodwill for a Christmasy ax
                murderer look. Boomer looking comfy as hell. Miss you Boomer.
            </p>

            <h2>2011</h2>

            <div class="blogimg">

            </div>

            <p>
                This is a personal favorite. I think this was at the height of some classic memes like <a
                    href=http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/karate-kyle>Karate Kyle</a> and <a
                    href=http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/vengeance-dad>Vengeance Dad,</a> and we sort of combined that
                with a middle school stock yearbook background. Delightfully weird.
            </p>

            <h2>2012</h2>

            <p>
                This one we made in Cristina's tiny room in SF. I had graduated grad school and was living between her
                place, my grandparents place, and my Ford Taurus. The theme was Hello Kitty. I guess I thought 2003
                popped collar fauxhawk dude fit with that, but Cristina looks great!
            </p>

            <h2>2013</h2>

            <div class="blogimg">
                <img src=https://i.imgur.com/6ivtah9.jpg />
            </div>

            <p>
                This was a funny card. We had just moved to Houston so we wanted to go full cowboy. It wasn't nearly as
                campy as we had made them before so we got a lot of comments like "Hey thats a great picture of you
                two!" Maybe we went too meta. To get the photo we drove into hill country and carried a camera on a
                tripod into some old settler reenactment village. People had no idea what the hell we were doing but we
                had a great time doing it.
            </p>

            <h2>2014</h2>

            <div class="blogimg">
                <img src=https://i.imgur.com/hqAyROZ.jpg />
            </div>

            <p>
                I think this is my favorite card we have done. I had been drinking lots of good beer and eating lots of
                amazing Texas food so I was just magnificently fat. We had to rehearse the letters, then set the camera
                timer and run and jump into position before the shutter clicked. Very hilarious to make, very fun to
                send out.
            </p>

                This year we went with a nice gingerbread theme. This was the first house we could really afford and I
                loved it but alas, it was delicious.
            </p>

                Another favorite. Taylor Swift had just released "1989" and we spent an afternoon scrounging through our
                parents old photos. I found one of myself sitting on Santa's lap, and Cristina found one of her sitting
                in a comparable position. Her photoshop skills did the rest. I can't tell you how many people sent texts
                amazed that we had known each other that long! We glued the pictures inside cards made of colored
                butcher paper and drew Christmas messages like kids with puff paint. I really loved making this one.
            </p>

            <h2>2017</h2>

            <div class="blogimg">

                This year's card! We sent them all out last week so if you haven't gotten it, sorry for the spoiler! I
                also may have your address wrong so sorry if that is the case. Our first Christmas with Coop, and there
                he is pulling us all over Seattle like he always does.
            </p>

            <p>
                This year we sent out around 70 cards. I made a little map of all the places we sent them this year. As
                you can see, we need more international addresses! Also missing a big chunk of middle America so if some
                of y'all could move out there that would be great. We love all of you and making and writing those cards
                is one of my favorite things to do every year.

                Been listening to lots of old music lately so I'll leave ya with some favorites. I'm also very much
                enjoying the new Charli XCX.
