            <p><em>Cancer update #23</em></p>

            <p>
                Well, it has been a few weeks since my last blog. I have currently wrapped up a round of three new
                treatments. These last few weeks have been some of the most challenging of my cancer journey thusfar.
            </p>

            <p>
                I say "new treatment" and unfortunately I am not talking about the immunotherapy clinical trial I was
                previously on. Three weeks ago I had my first scan after four rounds of treatment in the clinical trial.
                Sadly, we got some really demoralizing news, again. The treatments were not working. This was a huge
                bummer for me. I had been feeling pretty crummy but also had thought I was noticing some positive
                changes, so I had hope. This bastard in my chest had other ideas though and apparently it had still been
                growing the whole time. After much discussion with my oncologist, we decided to move on to a third line
                of treatment.
            </p>

            <p>
                SCCA is amazing though and no sooner had I been removed from the clinical trial I was getting my first
                infusion of a coctail called "Taxol-Ram." <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paclitaxel>Taxol</a> is
                a pretty standard chemo that is used in lots of different forms of cancer. My mom had it when she was
                beating breast cancer. The <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramucirumab>Ram</a> is interesting, as
                it is actually a different type of immunotherapy. It is often combined with the Taxol in gastric cancers
                like mine. My understanding of how it works is to somehow restrict bloodflow to the tumor and sort of
                suffocate it in a way.
            </p>

            <p>
                Up until this week, I had been feeling super drained. It was a challenge to walk around the block. I'm a
                sack of skin and bones, I don't have much fat left to speak of, so I also get real achy and sore where
                by bones stick out. I seem to have more GI problems than I can keep track of with new ones popping up
                each week. My medicine cabinet is gonna need a renovation at this rate. But all is not lost. I'm still
                hopeful. Hopeful that this new treatment helps out. I got a blood transfusion last week that has really
                given me a boost. I also gained 2 lbs in the last week which is great. Maybe this new treatment is doing
                some good! I would love to continue to get more energy, gain more weight, and maybe go on a light
                fall/winter hike with the girlfriend and the dog.
            </p>

            <p>
                I've been thinking a lot about caregivers recently. This last month has been incredibly hard. I could
                have never gotten through it without my caregiver, Cristina. I couldn't shop for my own groceries, I
                would get tired standing in the kitchen cooking dinner, and I definitely couldn't wait in line at the
                pharmacy for all the pills I need to take. Cristina is the most amazing caregiver and has never waivered
                in helping me live with as much independene and support as possible.
            </p>

            <p>
                Of course I have other caregivers in my life as well! I live with my brother Andy and his amazing
                girlfriend Kimberly who have been nothing but amazing support. My mom and dad, my brother Mike, and my
                extended family are also the most fantastic and supportive caregivers I could ask for. Then I have a
                great group of friends near and far. We had a little Seahawks watch party and some friends came down
                from Bellingham. Caregivers give time and not just physical but emotional support as well, and it was a
                great boost to have some time to hang out with awesome friends. Thanks Steve, Sam, and Rylan for driving
                down and everybody else for stopping by! It was also great to see my cousin Bryan as well!
            </p>

                So I'm dedicating this blog to all my amazing caregivers, and all the other amazing caregivers out
                there. I see them every day at SCCA and read about them in some of the online support groups I belong
                to. I love you all and thank you for helping me fight this shit!
            </p>

                Been listening to a ton of great music lately so I'll leave you with a couple of my favorites!
