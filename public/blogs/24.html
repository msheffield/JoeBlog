            <p><em>Cancer update #20</em></p>

            <p>
                Well the last few weeks have been great and very mediocre for me. I haven't been as inspired to write
                recently because I had been feeling a little defeated, but I'm back and glad to be writing again. The
                long and short of it is this cancer blows. I'll get into the details towards the end but first an update
                on what I've been up to the last couple weeks!
            </p>

            <p>
                I had five of my very best Houston friends come to Seattle and visit! Deb, Donna, Kathy, Scott and
                Mikey, thank you so much. We had a blast doing some of the touristy stuff, and doing what I was used to
                back in Houston: sitting around with a cold drink watching sports and bullshitting. We went to a
                Mariners game and checked out the <a href=https://www.mopop.org />MoPOP</a>, which was very cool!
            </p>

                It was so good to see y'all. Cristina and I really appreciated you guys coming up and it really lifted
                our spirits! Hope you all ride out this hurricane safely at Griff's!
            </p>

            <p>
                Other cool stuff I've been up to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>More Mariners games with some great friends.</li>
                <li>Checked out the Seahawks-Vikings preseason game. Cristina and I always like to travel to an away
                    game or two every year (Nashville next month!) but this was my first time at the Clink. A very cool
                    experience. Thanks Cam!</li>
                <li>Laid in the grass in the park with the pup and watched the eclipse. What a special thing. I love to
                    feel tiny in the face of the reality of the vastness of the universe, and lying there surrounded by
                    thousands of other Seattlites, eyes lifted skywards, I felt really small and it was great.</li>
                <li>Got another visit from a really great friend I hadn't seen in a long, long time. Hilary! Hil, Brett
                    and I had a little UPS reunion. So good to hang out with those two.</li>

                Other than that, the big changes for me these past few weeks have been on the cancer front. As I
                reported a few posts ago, the chemo stopped working, so we stopped the chemo. This has been great and
                awful simultaneously. Great because I can taste again! I can feel my fingers and toes again! I don't
                have to worry about running my hand under cold water! My thin hair is thickening up again! Best of all,
                I don't have to walk around with a chemo fanny pack for days at a time!
            </p>

            <p>
                It has also been awful and discouraging. The tumor has been growing again since the end of June. It.
                Feels. Massive. I can barely swallow anything solid or liquid. When I do swallow, if I'm lucky, it
                eventually migrates down to my stomach. If I'm not lucky, I have to run to the bathroom to puke. Since
                the beginning of the year I've now lost 78lbs. Getting food down as been really difficult. This means I
                get fatigued fairly easily. Other complications from a growing tumor are stickier blood. I had more
                clots, this time in my leg, so I have had to up my dose of blood thinner. I'm back to giving myself a
                shot twice a day now, which is annoying but managable. The size of the tumor also just causes a lot of
                pain in my stomach. Thankfully as of now it isn't so bad and I can regulate it with Tylenol.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now for some good news. I started my immunotherapy clinical trial. I had my first treatment last week
                and will receive treatment every two weeks. It takes awhile for immunotherapy to kick in, so currently I
                am not seeing any positive effects, but my fingers are crossed. Here is a video from my first day in the
                trial:
            </p>

            <div class="videowrapper">
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/evBoz5QWxCw"></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>
                Immunotherapy is pretty cool but Cristina understands how it works much better than I do. The trial I am
                on is not blind, so I actually know what drugs I am on. The first is called <a
                    href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nivolumab>Nivolumab</a>. This is a checkpoint inhibitor that
                works off of the PD-L1 biomarker. Here is a nice video Cristina showed me explaining it a little better:
            </p>

            <div class="videowrapper">
                <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/evBoz5QWxCw"></iframe>
            </div>

            <p>
                The second drug is currently called BMS-98016. Apparently the marketing folks havent figured out how
                they want to dress it up. This guy is an anti-LAG-3 monoclonal antibody! What the hell is that you might
                ask. Well, again, Cristina can explain it better than I, and she showed me another good video that helps
                you figure it out:
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>
                So anyways, basically I'm just waiting around for this new cocktail to kick in. These last few weeks
                have been quite a bit different than the first half year that I was on chemo. Back then I still wasn't
                feeling too physically hampered by this tumor. The last few weeks I have really been feeling like my
                body is wearing down a bit. Hopefully a shrinking tumor, and more food in my belly, are in my future.
                Either way, I'm still feeling strong and fighting like hell. Fuck this cancer.

                Cristina going. Thank y'all. We love you guys. This new Iron and Wine has been tickling my eardrums
