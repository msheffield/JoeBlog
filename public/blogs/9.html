            <p>
                I am writing this blog from Bellingham. A bunch of family is in town this weekend to celebrate my
                grandma's life. It has been really nice to see a bunch of folks and I am looking forward to seeing more
                as they arrive!
            </p>

                This week has been pretty good. Mike came down to hang out. We went and did pub trivia (we didn't win)
                and also saw the movie "Get Out", which was really good. Thanks for coming down Mike!
            </p>

                I have been feeling relatively pretty great this week. It is an off week for my chemo, and I seem to
                have taken the first dose pretty well. I basically stopped having the chemo symptoms after on Friday of
                last week, which is awesome. I believe the toxicity builds up in your system though with each dose so
                I'm anticipating it probably getting worse... but I'm going to enjoy feeling decent while I can!
            </p>

            <p>
                I've had some questions about my treatment schedule and when we will know stuff about how it is working.
                My current chemo schedule is:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Infusion at SCCA every other Tuesday.</li>
                <li>A take home assignment of more chemo for 46 hours after the hospital infusion.</li>
                <li>Scans every 6-8 weeks to see if we're shrinking anything.</li>
                <li>Repeat for ~12 rounds of chemo as long as my body cooperates.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                My next chemo treatment is this upcoming Tuesday. I am not sure if the scans I will have are of the PET
                or CT variety. Currently, I have the big tumor in my esophagus, and it has spread to a bunch of lymph
                nodes around it, as well as a lesion on the adrenal gland on my kidney, and finally a "maybe" metastasis
                in my lung. The scans will be checking to see if any of those are shrinking. Fingers crossed!

                Cristina and I grabged a drink with our friend Alyssa the other day and we were talking about how we
                take our bodies for granted until everything goes wrong. It's pretty incredible the little things we do
                every day that become such a chore when we can't do them anymore. Right now I measure the success of my
                meals in the amount of "bad bites" I have. If I don't take a small enough bite and chew the bite enough,
                the food gets stuck between the wall of my esophagus and the tumor. If I'm lucky I can get it down, if
                I'm not, it comes back up. We had pizza for my dad's birthday last night. It was a 2 bad bite meal which
                is pretty good! Another good example of this is pooping. Here's my dilemma with this:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>My chemo can give me diarrhea.</li>
                <li>The anti-nausea drugs I take for the chemo make me constipated.</li>
                <li>The iron pills I take for the bleeding in my chest make me constipated</li>
                <li>So I take Miralax to try to counter the constipation causing drugs that counter the diarrhea causing
                    drugs.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                I think my body is just very confused.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'll wrap this up by letting everyone know how excited I am for baseball season to start. Those that
                know me know I am a big all around sports fan, but baseball is my absolute favorite. The Mariners are
                looking pretty decent this season but I'm nervous about their rotation. I anticipate another season of
                big expectations, a promising start followed by a June swoon and a heartbreaking September but still,
                maybe this is their year! I would love to get to see a playoff game at Safeco. The last playoff game I
                attended was in the Kingdome. I'll leave you with my favorite Modern Baseball song that I listen to all
                the time.
