            <p><em>Cancer update #18</em></p>

            <p>
                The last 2 weeks had some great highs and some mediocre lows. The 4th of July is my favorite holiday and
                we did some good celebrating. We went and visted some friends in West Seattle for a great BBQ in the
                afternoon and then came back to our neck of the woods to watch the show over Lake Union. Coop did pretty
                good for his first fireworks show but he was still a little anxious.

                The other awesome thing we did this week was go on our first backpack with the new pup. He did great and
                we had a blast with some good friends and other good doggos. I made a little video of our outing which
                turned into basically a Cooper video and I didn't get all the humans we were with much time in the
                video. Apologies to all the other great folks we were with on the trip!

            <p>
                On the cancer front, this last week was not the best. Normally this is a chemo week for me. I had been
                having some greater difficulty swallowing in the last couple weeks, and some of my bloodwork had some
                alarming numbers, so my doctor pushed up my scan to this Monday. Unfortunately, it looks like the chemo
                has stopped being effective, and the tumor is growing again. My doctor took me off chemo, and I am
                currently trying to get into a <a
                    href=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02935634?term=NCT02935634&rank=1>clinical trial</a> that
                is going on right now.
            </p>

            <p>
                The clinical trial is an immunotherapy trial for a drug called <a
                    href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nivolumab>Nivolumab</a> in combination with another barely
                pronouncable drug called <a href=Ipilimumab>Ipilimumab</a>. Try saying that one a few times. I will
                either be getting those two drugs, or the Nivolumab and a drug lovingly named "BMS-98016". I discussed
                this in a blog awhile back but Nivolumab is a checkpoint inhibitor that against the <a
                    href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death_protein_1>PD-1</a> protein in my tumor.
                This is about where my understanding starts to fail, but hopefully my tumor responds to this treatment!
                Side effects apparently could be: sever skin irritation, inflamed lungs, diabetes, and thyroid problems.
                So apologies in advance if I start flaking skin and coughing everywhere. As I experienced my last time
                trying to get into a clinical trial, I will not consider myself in the trial until I am actually getting
                the drugs pumped into my chest. Hopefully my tumor doesn't start bleeding before then.
            </p>

            <p>
                So thats the bad news. I have a growing problem. How I'm feeling this week:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Disappointed. I'm disappointed that the chemo stopped working. I was pretty overwhelmed meeting my
                    doc on Tuesday to go over the results. All these weeks of feeling like shit, only to have the tumor
                    start growing again. Thankfully it shrunk pretty significantly initially, but I would have loved to
                    keep that going. My doctor was also disappointed: she says usually folks that have such great
                    results after the first scan continue to have good results.</li>
                <li>Scared. There aren't a lot of treatments out there for this cancer, and to check one off the list
                    and still have this tumor is pretty scary. Cristina and I were watching some of the travel videos
                    I've made of our trips together and I'm scared I won't be able to go on more big adventures with
                    her. I'm scared about missing out on a lot of things.</li>
                <li>Hopeful. I'm hopeful for that this clinical trial produces results. I'm hopeful that I can beat the
                    odds and start shrinking this tumor again. I'm going to do everything I can to keep my immune system
                    running in overdrive: exercising, getting outside, eating well, and enjoying life.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                To wrap up this blog, I had a nice chat over some beers with a friend, Nattalie, about how helpful
                positive thinking is. Yes, I was disappointed, yes, I am kind of scared, but I still think the best
                thing I can do for myself is to not fall into thinking about "why me". Who knows "why me"? I'm going to
                continue to enjoy everything I can: every snuggle with Coop, every date with Cristina, every meaningful
                conversation over a pint with great friends, every visit from family, every sunrise and sunset. I can't
                let any negativity get in the way of that.
            </p>

                Been listening to this Brockhampton album a bunch this week. Loving this track:
