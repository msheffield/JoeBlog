            <p><em>Cancer update #14</em></p>

            <p>
                This week was my 6th chemo treatment and I am not sure if my body is acclimating to it or what but I
                feel like it was my easiest treatment. My only symptom this week was the awful taste that I've talked
                about that makes food taste awful. Cristina and I even went out and had tacos and margaritas with my
                chemo purse in tow. I am finishing this blog in the waiting room of the infusion center. I am waiting to
                get disconnected from my pump, after which I will have the highlight of my week, a shower. Since I have
                this tube coming out of my chest, I can't really shower for the two days I am getting the drugs. These
                post chemo showers are always very nice.
            </p>

            <p>
                This week Evan came and hung out with me while I got the infusion in the infusion center. Had a great
                time hanging out with him. Lots of good talk about baseball and coding to take my mind off the nastiness
                being pumped into me. Thank you Evan! Here is a little snap story from the day:
            </p>

            <p>
                I actually got some great news on Tuesday. I had my first CT scan since starting treatment. I had a scan
                around noon, and then I had to sit around waiting for the results from my doctor at 4:15. I didn't feel
                very nervous because I think the worst news I received was on February 23rd after my first CT scan.
                Nothing can really top that. Well my doctor walked in and said she had "fantastic results". After 5
                treatments, my main tumor has shrunk by about 50%, the largest lymph node in the chest is now
                "subcentemeter", the largest lymph node in the abdomen has shrunk by about 50%, and the metastasis on my
                adrenal gland is now "subcentemeter". This is very cool. Everything else on my CT report is either
                "normal" or "unremarkable". The dream is to be unremarkable in every way.
            </p>

            <p>
                So this is some awesome news. The tumor, lymph nodes, and mets are still there but they are shrinking.
                The fight isn't over, but we're making great progress! At this point I think I want to throw in some
                thank yous. Thank you to everyone that has reached out to me with positive, encouraging messages and
                prayers, thank you to all my friends for their amazing support, thank you to my family for their
                unconditional love and encouragement, thank you to mine and Cristina's friends for your support and love
                for her, and thank you to Cristina for being by my side through this whole ordeal. This would be a lot
                lonelier fight without the mountain of support we have been getting, so thank you.
            </p>

            <p>
                So that is the big cancer news from me this week. Memorial day was tons of fun, we had a BBQ on the
                beach. It was great to get some sun and hang out with good friends, good dogs, and good beer.

                I also spent some time this week putting together a video of our family trip to Yosemite. If anyone is
                curious, here are some fun shots from the trip for y'all to enjoy. It's good to remember in times like
                these how precious and beautiful and important this planet is.

                I'll end this blog with some thoughts on this cancer process. This week, I met with my fantastic
                palliative care ARNP, Meagan Blazey. We talked about some good things, and I did something I never
                thought about before or never thought I would need to do until I was much older: I gave Cristina my
                "Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care". This is actually really important for us, as we're not
                legally married. If my cancer does progress, I'll eventually probably need someone to help me make
                medical decisions. Before Wednesday, that duty would have gone to my parents. I love my parents, but
                Cristina is my partner in life, we love and trust each other unconditionally, and we have been together
                so long and know each other so well, she is the one that I would want making these important decions.
            </p>

            <p>
                Life is crazy and unpredictable, and it is really important to have these conversations with loved ones
                no matter how old you are. Even though it can seem strange to talk about how you would want to to be
                treated medically as you were dying, it is an important discussion to have before that time comes. I'm
                currently going through more of this stuff. I'm making a "Health Care Directive" which is basically a
                legal document stipulating your wishes for how you want to be cared for if you're close to death.
                Anyways, I don't want to get depressing, but for anyone reading this, I think its an important thing to
                discuss with those that you love and love you!
            </p>

                I've been listening to this new Pixx album nonstop all week. This song might be my favorite of 2017, and
                the video is rad.
