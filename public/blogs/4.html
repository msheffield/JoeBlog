            <p>Well this blog is going to take a sharp turn in 2017. The good news is I found a job! I was offered a
                position as a Full Stack Developer with <a href=http://spry-group.com />The Spry Group.</a> I am really
                happy with this work and love the projects I have been working on.</p>

            <p>This last Wednesday, unfortunately, I received some pretty shitty news. I was diagnosed with esophageal
                cancer. This is a bad diagnosis. I don’t know much yet but right now it looks inoperable. I have a
                meeting tomorrow, Monday, with a specialist at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance to discuss other
                treatment options.</p>

            <p>In the last few days, I have received the most amazing support from all my friends and family. I cannot
                put into words what each text, call, or visit has meant to me. Thank you so much for your messages and
                your prayers. Because sometimes I might not be able to return every text and call, I would like to use
                this blog as a place for me to give the people I love updates on my treatment and experiences with this
                disease. I love every one of you and I you all mean the world to me. I am really lucky to have such a
                strong support system, as well as two physician parents who can advocate for my treatment. This would be
                even scarier to be going through alone.</p>

            <p>Thanks for reading. I’m not giving up. Hopefully I can get this blog back to the tech/jobsearch/lifestyle
                blog I originally intended it to be.</p>

            <p>Love, Joe</p>
