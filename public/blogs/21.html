            <p><em>Cancer update #17</em></p>

            <p>
                Well this week was a cool one. I just got disconnected from chemo yesterday so I'm still feeling a
                little fatigued and I can't taste food really. Other than that I am feeling pretty decent! It was my
                birthday on Wednesday, and while I was sitting at home on chemo that day, we did some good celebrating
                the rest of the week.
            </p>

            <p>
                Cristina and Cam and my parents did a little organizing and threw me a surprise birthday party out at my
                folks place on Lummi Island. I was totally in the dark and very surprised when I got out there. I had a
                blast, we had a keg and some lawn games and a fire on the beach and blew up some fireworks... basically
                everything I love in life, friends, family, beer and explosions. Thank you to all my friends that came
                out, it really means so much to me. My love meter was full up after that weekend.
            </p>

                Monday we came back and Cristina took me to birthday dinner at a place I've been dreaming about going
                since I moved back to Seattle: <a href=http://sushikashiba.com />Sushi Kashiba</a>. I love sushi. I
                could eat sushi all day, every day. This is supposed to be the best sushi in Seattle and boy was it. We
                sat at the sushi bar and had Omakase and it was amazing. If you want good sushi in Seattle you have to
                check it out.

                Tuesday I had chemo and Andy was my chemo buddy. I was feeling pretty drained from the weekend and
                getting the chemo so I kind of just napped and didn't really take any videos or anything, but thank you
                to my brother for sitting by my side and supporting me!
            </p>

            <p>
                Wednesday my parents came down and we went out and had a low key actual birthday dinner. We got Thai
                food because when I'm on the chemo, I can only semi-enjoy either really spicy, really citrusy, or really
                sweet foods. It was a really nice dinner with the fam.
            </p>

                The title of this post is "Why I'm Lucky" and I called it that because of a conversation I had with
                Cristina this week. Getting cancer may seem like a real unlucky turn in life, but I refuse to go down
                that road. Whether they give me 6 months or 6 years to live, I'm gonna use that time filling my life
                with love and happiness and not dwell on one unlucky hiccup. The 30th year of my life has actually been
                a pretty amazing year.
            </p>

            <p>
                I went back to school and got a job and changed careers. Cristina and I traveled all over. We did a
                multi day river raft through eastern Oregon:

                We adopted a <a href=https://www.instagram.com/__coopdog__ />dog</a> and bought a new car!

            <p>
                Most importantly I feel closer to my friends and family, and to Cristina, then I ever have in my life.
                I'm lucky because of you.

                So here's hoping to another lucky 31st year. I'll wrap this up with a little update on the cancer stuff.
                I do not have the mismatch repair deficiency, which is a bit of a bummer because I'll have to find
                another way to get the Keytruda immunotherapy, but oh well. I've been having some rougher swallows than
                usual, and some of my bloodwork has shown some interesting numbers so my team is pushing up my next scan
                til next month. Fingers crossed the chemo is still working, if not, we will have to try another route. I
                will keep y'all updated.
            </p>

                This new track from St. Vincent is great!
