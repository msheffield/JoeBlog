            <p><em>Cancer update #12</em></p>

            <p>
                This week marks my 5th round of chemo. My symptoms this week were <em>relatively</em> mild! I didn't
                have any of the usual stomach cramping, no nausea. I did have the normal feeling of being totally
                drained of energy. The worst symptom this week was the taste in my mouth. It is awful. I've read of
                people getting a metallic taste but for me it is nothing like that, it is more of a slimy feeling, and
                it makes eating food super gross. But all in all it was a decent chemo week.
            </p>

            <p>
                Danny was my chemo buddy this week! If there is one great thing to come from going into the infusion
                center and getting gross chemicals pumped into my chest, it is the total feeling of love and support
                from my friends. I've had so many people reach out to me and say they want to hang out next time I go in
                for chemo. I really appreciate it. Makes the few hours I am there go by way faster. So it was great this
                week hanging out with Danny talking sports and stuff. I usually post a little snap story here but this
                week my chemo brain got the best of me and I forgot to download it. I lost it in the cyber. Thanks for
                hanging out Danny!
            </p>

            <p>
                Other than chemo, this week was an especially great one for a couple of reasons. Andy graduated from law
                school on Saturday, and we had the whole family down in Seattle. I wrote about Andy last week but I'll
                just reiterate how proud we all are of Andy's awesome accomplishment. There was a lot of good discussion
                by the speakers about what a vital role lawyers play in defending Americans. I remember watching all the
                volunteer laywers at the airports recently after the Muslim ban was enacted, and thinking how cool it
                was that Andy was going to be able to be helping soon as well. Here is a photo after the ceremony:

                This week was also special for me because I had the best baseball experience of my life on Monday.
                Cristina, through a friend of my mom's, was put in contact with <a
                    href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Stanton>John Stanton</a>, the majority owner of the
                Mariners. As a surprise to me, she arranged a tour of Safeco before the game on Monday. I only found out
                a few hours before gametime... I was planning on having a relaxing night before chemo the next day! We
                were instructed to wait in the Diamond Club lobby, and an "executive" would meet us and escort us onto
                the field to watch batting practice. It turned out to be two executives escorting us: Mr. Stanton, and
                <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Mather>Kevin Mather</a>, the President of the Mariners. I
                can honestly say it was the most surprised I have ever been. Both of them could not have been nicer,
                warmer, or more welcoming to a gobsmacked 30 year old that felt like a little kid again. They brought us
                out to the field and we stood right next to the batting cage as all our favorite players took BP. We
                chatted with Scott Servais, the Mariners manager, and with a bunch of players. When I say I felt like a
                kid I really mean it (I'm getting excited just typing up this description). We wandered around the
                dugout taking handfuls of gum and packets of seeds, I played around on the bullpen phone, Mr. Mather
                regailed us with old stories of childhood heroes: Ichiro, Edgar, Bone, Griffey, and many others. It was
                surreal. We got thirsty in the locker room and Robinson Cano got us bottles of water. We got to see the
                entire stadium from the locker rooms to the press box. They made us reservations at the "Hit It Here
                Cafe" out in right field, and they gave us some amazing tickets right next to the dugout for the game.
                We didn't take any cell phone pics, but the team photographer took some good ones that I will post once
                we get them. I have loved baseball and the Mariners since I was a child, and I am so happy to know that
                they are run by such kind, warm, generous people. It was an amazing evening, and the happiest I have
                felt in a long time. Thank you so much to the entire Mariners organization, and to Cristina for somehow
                being able to keep a surprise from me for a couple weeks!
            </p>

            <p>
                To close out this blog I wanted to say that one thing I have really enjoyed since my diagnosis is
                talking about life with some of the people at <a href=https://www.seattlecca.org />SCCA</a> that are not
                doctors. They have an amazing staff, and one of my favorite people to talk to is one of the Staff
                Chaplains, Mike Yonkers. He is close to my age and has a great perspective on things. I am not a
                religious person, but I met with him at first because I have a lot of religious friends and family who
                have shown me amazing support. I wanted to be able to be better at receiving the love and support that
                was coming from a perspective that I wasn't as familiar with, so I met with Mike to talk about it. In
                our subsequent meetings, we actually usually don't talk religion at all, just about living with cancer
                and living with more purpose. I guess the lesson for me in this is that sometimes some amazing support
                can come from a place that I would never have expected. This week we talked about living more in the
                present, and Mike introduced me to a poem by <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wagoner>David
                    Wagoner</a> called <em>Lost</em>.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Stand still. The trees ahead and bushes beside you</li>
                <li>Are not lost. Wherever you are is called Here,</li>
                <li>And you must treat it as a powerful stranger,</li>
                <li>Must ask permission to know it and be known.</li>
                <li>The forest breathes. Listen. It answers,</li>
                <li>I have made this place around you.</li>
                <li>If you leave it, you may come back again, saying Here.</li>
                <li>No two trees are the same to Raven.</li>
                <li>No two branches are the same to Wren.</li>
                <li>If what a tree or bush does is lost on you,</li>
                <li>You are surely lost. Stand still. The forest knows</li>
                <li>Where you are. You must let it find you.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                This poem really speaks to me. I'm going to keep looking for the Here in the forest, or let it find me.
            </p>

            <p>
                My family and I are off on a road trip next week to Yosemite so hopefully I will have some great
                pictures to post next Friday. The entire city of Seattle is mourning Chris Cornell, so I'll leave you
                with my favorite song of his.
