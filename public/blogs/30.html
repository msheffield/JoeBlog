            <p><em>Cancer update #26</em></p>

            <p>
                Happy belated New Year! For me 2018 has brought many changes. New goals, family updates, and on the
                cancer front, sadly, a new chemo treatment.
            </p>

            <p>
                Unfortunately, the day after Christmas, I had a scan to find out why I was having higher cancer blood
                markers and swallowing issues. The scan showed that the cancer was progressing again. The main tumor had
                not grown much, but some of the mets on my adrenal glands had grown, and there was some new lymph node
                involvement. My medical team is amazing though and after much discussion we decided to stop the
                Taxol-Ram chemo I was on and switch to a new chemo regimin called <a
                    href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOLFIRI>FOLFIRI</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is very similar to the first chemo regimin I was on, the FOLFOX. Two of the drugs are the same, the
                Folinic Acid and the Fluorouracil. The only difference is that this time instead of the Oxaliplatin I am
                getting a drug called Irinotecan. Treatments on this cocktail are every two weeks, and I am back to
                having the take home pump with me for two days after I am infused in the hospital. This is probably the
                biggest bummer for me. I hate that thing. I had my first treatment last week and the take home pump is
                as annoying as I remembered. You can't shower so you feel gross for two days, and it just totally saps
                you of energy. Oh well though, hopefully this new drug does something to this cancer.
            </p>

            <p>
                The doctors also say I might lose my hair from the Irinotecan. I've been told that on the last two
                chemos I've been on though and I still have my thick Italian head of hair so we will see. The only hair
                I seem to have lost was my beard hair weirdly enough. There are a few other different side effects of
                the Irinotecan compared to the Oxaliplatin. I am not having any of the cold sensitivity, which is very
                nice especially in the winter. Also, apparently Irinotecan is affectionately known as "I-ran-to-the-can"
                for reasons I will let you figure out. I'll just say that the name is appropriate.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thats about all there is for me on the cancer front. Hopefully this chemo works because I think we're
                running out of chemo options unfortunately. If this didn't work I think we would have to hopefully find
                some crazy medical trial to try and get me into which is a little scary. Currently though I am feeling
                pretty good! I have energy and am able to do most of the things that I want to do so that is nice.
            </p>

                2018 did not start off the best for my family. Shortly after Christmas, we flew down to Santa Rosa to
                say goodbye to my Grandpa Jake. It was really nice to be there with the whole family. He was lucid for
                lots of our time there and we were able to talk and reminisce about his amazing life. My grandpa was the
                coolest. He was a doctor in the Navy and a pioneering heart surgeon. He was a big sports fan and I think
                a large reason I am such a big baseball fan today. He always let me win at Gin and couldn't resist
                trying to shoot the moon when we played hearts. I think the most important thing I learned from my
                Grandpa was the importance of family. He had the most amazing heart for the family he and my Grandma had
                helped create. My grandma was the love of his life and he held on long enough to help celebrate her 90th
                birthday. He <a href=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/pressdemocrat/obituary.aspx?pid=187760757>passed
                    away</a> on the 30th while we were in the air flying home. I found a couple photos of him while we
                were there and thought they captured his spirit pretty well.

                Other than that, we've got a lot of fun stuff going on in our lives right now. Cristina and I started
                taking a ceramics class and we are having a blast. I said in a post last year that I wanted to do
                something artistic and we are finally making time for that and it feels great.
            </p>

            <p>
                We also have some travel plans. We are headed to Hawaii at the end of this month! We are going to visit
                Cristina's brother and nephew on Oahu for a few days, then fly over to the Big Island and do some
                touristy stuff. The geologist in me is really, really excited. Also I'm pale as hell and need some
                vitamin D. Other places we want to travel this year include NYC and Japan. Also they just announced a
                Seahawks game in London next season which would be awesome for Cristina and my annual away game. Also
                there has been talk of going back to my favorite city in the world, NOLA, for Kimberly's dirty 30. And
                most importantly, I have to get down to Houston. It has been way too long and I am missing my friends
                down there and have been wanting to visit all my old favorite haunts and restaurants and taco stands. I
                love Seattle but I haven't had a decent taco since I left Houston.
            </p>

            <p>
                My brothers are starting 2018 off in awesome ways. Mike is getting ready to head back to NYC to go back
                to school. It has been amazing to have him around for support and love and help while I've been sick,
                but I am so happy he is going to go back and pursue his passions. He is the smartest person I know and
                can't wait to sit in on some lecture he is giving in the future. Andy just got a job yesterday as well!
                He is going to be a public defender down in Pierce County which is amazing. It is exactly what he wanted
                to be doing. I can't wait to sit in on him in court someday. Our criminal justice system is so broken
                and I am really glad that there are folks like Andy out there fighting for the people caught in its
                horrible grasp.
            </p>

            <p>
                My other goal this year was to do a bunch more cooking. I've always loved to cook but I've started
                keeping a recipe journal and trying to come up with my own recipes and tweaking old ones and finding out
                what works and what doesn't work. So far I have been having a great time and it has been really fun to
                get off my ass, blast some music and cook all day.
            </p>

            <p>
                It was Cooper's first birthday on the 8th. Since Cristina and I don't have any kids, we threw him the
                human birthday we've been unable to throw. He had baloons, a doggie cupcate, and the whole family came
                down to celebrate. This guy has helped us get through a really tough year. He brightens up our whole
                house and we really do love him with all our heart. Dogs are the best.

                I try to stay away from politics in this blog but I've been especially bothered by our shithole
                President today. I usually try and ignore his idiocy as much as possible just because I don't want to
                spend whatever time I have on this earth dwelling on politics but sometimes you can't avoid it. My
                family is full of immigrants. Growing up I loved hearing the stories of my family coming over from Italy
                to find their way here. Immigrants and workers are the backbone of this country. I'm especially bothered
                by his racist comments against Asians today. As a guy madly in love with somebody from that part of the
                world, I just find the whole ordeal sad and depressing. I've been thinking a lot about my cancer and
                while I would love to beat this and live a long healthy life, right now I just really hope I live to see
                this turd gone and forgotten.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thats about it for this New Years update. I'm planning on cramming as much into my 2018 as I possibly
                can. New experiences, new travel, and I just want to learn as much new stuff as I possibly can. I want
                to be a sponge for new knowledge. I want to cook better. I'm learning how to make stuff out of clay. I
                want to spend as much time as I can with friends and family as long as I am feeling good. I want to
                snuggle with my dog as much as I possibly can. I don't want to dwell on negativity and be as present as
                possible. I hope that however crazy this world can seem everybody realizes how lucky we are to be alive
                and with each other. I hope you all have an amazing 2018 and don't take this year for granted! Hopefully
                I still have my hair by my next blog.
            </p>

            <p>
                Its a new year but I still like music and I still like sharing what I've been listening to lately.
